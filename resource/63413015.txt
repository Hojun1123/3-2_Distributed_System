', 'Dr Paddy Dempsey, research fellow at the University of Leicester and Medical Research Council (MRC) epidemiology unit at the University of Cambridge, said: "Without accurate records of physical activity duration and intensity, it hasn\'t been possible to sort out the contribution of more vigorous physical activity from that of overall physical activity volume. ', '"Wearable devices helped us to accurately detect and record the intensity and duration of movement.', '"Moderate and vigorous intensity activity gives a greater reduction in the overall risk of early death.', '"More vigorous physical activity may also reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, over and above the benefit seen from the total amount of physical activity, as it stimulates the body to adapt to the higher effort required."', 'Prof Tom Yates, professor of physical activity, sedentary behaviour and health at the university, said: "We found that achieving the same overall amount of physical activity through higher-intensity activity has a substantial additional benefit. ', '"Our findings support simple behaviour-change messages that \'every move counts\' to encourage people to increase their overall physical activity, and if possible to do so by incorporating more moderately intense activities.', '"This could be as simple as converting a leisurely stroll into a brisk walk."', '<i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">Follow BBC East Midlands on </i><a href="https://www.facebook.com/bbceastmids/" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Facebook</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">,  </i><a href="https://twitter.com/bbcemt" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Twitter</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">, or  </i><a href="https://www.instagram.com/bbceastmidlands/" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Instagram</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">.
