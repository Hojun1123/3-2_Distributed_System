', 'The Welsh government said the number infected was low and the risk of catching monkeypox "extremely" low. ', 'Sexual health consultant Dr Olwen Williams called the lack of vaccine a "huge concern".', '"The last few weeks we haven\'t been able to distribute it at all," she said.', '"We have been able to give it to people who have been direct contacts of people, but there\'s been such a huge surge of individuals across the UK coming forward for the vaccine, that it\'s really outstripped the demand.', '"There\'s a possibility that there will be an increase of cases because of supply issues."', 'Dr Williams urged people to be <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-45665821" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">aware of the symptoms</a> and isolate if they develop them. ', 'She added: "If people acknowledge the need to use condoms if they\'re having sexual activity then we might just slow the spread.', '"We\'re coming up to Pride in Cardiff over the bank holiday weekend, so again it\'s making sure people are aware of what the risks are and coming forward when they\'re called to get their vaccine."', 'Those currently eligible for vaccination in Wales are some health workers, people who have come into contact with the virus, or men who are gay, bisexual or have sex with other men.', 'The UK Health Security Agency said this week it would hold back doses for <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-62551821" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">people already exposed to the virus</a>.', 'LGBTQ+ campaigner Christian Webb received an official text to confirm he was eligible for the vaccine.', 'As a gay man he was deemed to be in an at risk group.

We have a population who are willing to go out and vaccinate but without that supply we can\'t."

', 'He said: "If there is a month break where we have lots of close contact, lots of festivals, lots of things happening, I fear without a continued effort we might see cases increasing." ', 'Even after he was messaged to say he was eligible for vaccination, getting jabbed was tricky. ', '"I received a link for the vaccine but the link didn\'t work," Mr Webb said.
