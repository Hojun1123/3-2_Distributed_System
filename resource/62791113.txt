', 'Energy bosses have been meeting with government officials on the matter.', 'A £100bn plan to freeze household bills was proposed by energy companies last month. ', 'Under the proposal, bills would be subsidised and the current price cap of £1,971 for a typical family would be maintained for two years.', 'The BBC understands that a similar scheme will be used to limit the energy price increases being experienced by small and medium-sized businesses.', 'And bigger companies may be offered tax breaks to help them through the period of high prices.', 'Ms Truss beat rival Rishi Sunak with 57% of party member votes to become the new Conservative leader.', 'Speaking after the announcement, she said: "I will deliver on the energy crisis, dealing with people\'s energy bills but also dealing with the long-term issues we have on energy supply."', 'In response, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: "There can be no justification for not freezing energy prices.', '"There\'s a political consensus that needs to happen. She needs to ask the question, how she\'s going to pay for that? Labour made it clear, it needs to be a windfall tax on oil and gas companies."', 'Ms Truss\'s team is understood to have been working on a support package for energy bills "for weeks". An announcement on what they will do is pencilled in for this Thursday.', '"Lots of measures have been considered, some have progressed and some have not," a source told the BBC.

Will there be anything similar for billpayers in Northern Ireland who have also seen the cost of heating and lighting homes rise? What about small businesses, who are also seeing bills surge?', 'We should not expect answers yet. We should wait for a policy announcement first.', 'Paul Johnson, director of the IFS, said "simply cutting taxes, cutting National Insurance contributions for example, is not a strategy for growth".', "He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme these measures would come on top of the billions the government would have to spend to help with energy bills.", '"We\'ll have not just extremely high borrowing in the short run but also additional inflationary pressure," he said.', 'Last month, Labour said the government should freeze household energy bills, outlining a £29bn plan that would stop the energy price cap going up for all homes. ', 'At the time, Ms Truss dismissed the proposal as a "sticking plaster". ', 'The Lib Dems have called for a price cap rise in October - which will take the typical household energy bill from £1,971 to £3,549 - to be scrapped. It proposed that the cost be covered by a windfall tax on energy company profits.', 'Ms Truss did not rule out a freeze during her Sunday interview with Laura Kuenssberg, but there is still a lack of clarity about how it could be funded.
