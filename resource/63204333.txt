The number of those inactive because they are long-term sick hit a record high of nearly 2.5 million.', 'Mr Freeman added: "While the number of job vacancies remains high after its long period of rapid growth, it has now dropped back a little, with a number of employers telling us they\'ve reduced recruitment due to a variety of economic pressures."', 'The estimated number of vacancies in the three months to September fell by 46,000 to 1,246,000, the largest fall since mid-2020 during the Covid pandemic.', 'Ruth Gregory at Capital Economics said that while there were "tentative signs that the labour market is cooling from the red-hot conditions seen in recent months, the shortfall in labour supply is keeping it exceptionally tight".
