', 'Prof Varma was involved in the establishment of the hospital, which first opened its doors to patients in 2012.', 'The cardiologist fears that if emergency general surgery was moved to Altnagelvin in Londonderry, lives would be unnecessarily lost.', '"They are bypassing an acute hospital, which has state-of-the-art facilities, to go to another hospital over roads that are far from satisfactory, and at least an hour plus journey," he said.', '"It has been shown in the medical literature, the longer the journey to a hospital, the greater the morbidity and the mortality.', '"So the people in Fermanagh will definitely suffer."', 'Prof Varma added it was "not an excuse that people are suddenly resigning" and accused the Western Trust of failing to recruit staff in a timely manner.', 'Geraldine McKay, director of acute services at the Western Trust, said they had become increasingly concerned at the "fragility of emergency general surgery" at the hospital.', 'Ms McKay said the three current staff surgeons were being supported by locums, but even that team may change soon.', '"In recent days, we have been notified of forthcoming changes in the staff team which, unless restored, will leave it impossible to sustain a safe emergency general surgery service at the hospital," she said.', 'The issue was not money but the workforce and the challenge of recruiting and retaining experienced consultant surgeons to provide a service, the trust said.', 'Jill Weir, a branch secretary of the Unison union, said the fate of emergency surgery and its potential impact on the rest of the hospital was very concerning.
