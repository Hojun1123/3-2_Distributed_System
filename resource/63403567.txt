['<b class="ssrcss-hmf8ql-BoldText e5tfeyi3">Rishi Sunak faced his first Prime Minister\'s Questions on Wednesday.</b>', 'Here are a few of the claims he made.', 'Mr Sunak quoted the police numbers in response to a question from Sir Keir Starmer. ', 'The Labour leader wanted to know about  Home Secretary Suella Braverman - who is in charge of policing - and whether her "integrity and professionalism are beyond question". ', 'A target to recruit 20,000 additional police officers in England and Wales by March 2023 was set out in the 2019 Conservative Party manifesto. ', 'It was an attempt to reverse cuts since 2010, which had seen the number of officers fall by about 19,000.', '<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/police-officer-uplift-quarterly-update-to-september-2022/police-officer-uplift-england-and-wales-quarterly-update-to-30-september-2022#introduction-1" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Figures released on Wednesday,</a> for the period up to 30 September, show that just over 15,300 officers have been recruited. ', 'So, police forces still have to recruit almost 5,000 more officers to meet the spring deadline.', 'They are also having trouble retaining officers. ', "In the year to March 2022, more than 8,000 police officers left forces in England and Wales. That's a 35% increase on the previous year and the highest volume of leavers in almost 20 years.", 'There are concerns about the impact of so many experienced officers leaving.', 'The prime minister was responding to a question about the need for more doctors and dentists.', "He's got his numbers about right. ", 'There were about 4,000 more community and hospital doctors, and 9,230 more nurses and health visitors working in the NHS in England in June 2022 (<a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/nhs-workforce-statistics/june-2022" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">the latest figures available</a>) compared with the previous June.

He said he would support it "if local communities support it".', 'Mr Sunak was responding to a Labour MP who said a nurse would have to work for thousands of years "to match the vast wealth of this prime minister".', 'He was involved in decisions about public sector pay when he was chancellor, from February 2020 until July 2022.', 'There was <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-56285087" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">particular criticism</a> in March 2021 for the proposed 1% pay rise for nurses in England, which was <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-57922712" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">increased to 3%</a> in July that year, with the award backdated to April.

If anything, it was a small cut in real terms.', 'Several unions representing nurses are balloting, or planning to ballot members, for strike action over pay, including Unison, the Royal College of Nursing, Royal College of Midwives, GMB and Unite.', '<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-41928747" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?
