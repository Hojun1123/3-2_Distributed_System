', '"But also there\'s a community who lives here, there\'s a community that farms here, there\'s a community that does business here. And we need all of those various aspects together to develop a plan which everyone agrees on which is in the best interests of this beautiful area".', "The researchers will work with the department's innovation lab.", 'Previously, plans were mooted about <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-19550802" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">making the Mournes Northern Ireland\'s first National Park</a>, and installing <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-17513588" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">a cable car on Slieve Donard.  </a>', 'With land across the mountains in both public and private ownership, researchers are aware of the complexities.
