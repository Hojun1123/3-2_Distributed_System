', '"Another way to think about it is that you could roughly double the emissions that you save by following a plant-based diet if the land was allowed to re-wild or re-forest," Dr Behrens said.', "There's a growing realisation that climate change and nature are inextricably linked and must be tackled together.", ' "It\'s really about having a joined-up picture of food policy and land policy and climate policy at the same time and fundamentally re-aligning subsidies in order to harness this," he added.', 'The study is published in <a href="https://www.nature.com/natfood/" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Nature Food</a>.', 'In England, farmers and landowners could be paid to turn large areas of land into nature reserves, or to restore floodplains, under new government agriculture subsidies.', 'Follow Helen <a href="https://twitter.com/hbriggs" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">on Twitter.</a>', 'Â© 2022 BBC.
