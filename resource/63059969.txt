They occur naturally but are exacerbated by nutrients from phosphate in pollutants such as sewage.', 'The Love Windermere partnership, which includes the Environment Agency, United Utilities, the Lake District National Park Authority and the National Trust, has said it was "committed to developing the most effective solutions to maintain and improve water quality in the lake".', '<i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">Follow BBC North East &amp; Cumbria on </i><a href="https://twitter.com/BBCNEandCumbria" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Twitter</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">, </i><a href="https://www.facebook.com/bbcneandcumbria" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Facebook</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2"> and </i><a href="https://www.instagram.com/bbcneandcumbria/" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Instagram</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">.
