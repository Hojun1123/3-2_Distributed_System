As such we\'re now calling on government for urgent and increased action to help tackle these issues."', 'A spokesperson for Water UK said: "We are currently experiencing some disruption to the supply in England of ferric sulphate, a chemical used at some drinking and waste water treatment sites.', '"This will not affect the supply of drinking water. As a precaution, however, we are monitoring the situation due to the use of ferric sulphate in some waste treatment works. ', '"We are working closely with government and our chemical suppliers to ensure disruption is minimised.', '"This issue has arisen due to a shortage of HGV drivers in the UK. There is no shortage of ferric sulphate in factories; the issue is solely one of distribution."', 'A government spokesperson said: "This action is strictly time-limited and there are robust conditions in place to mitigate risks to the environment.
