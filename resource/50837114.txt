', "The Bank of England is the UK's central bank. It is independent of the government.", 'Its main job is to manage the overall state of the economy, and the stability of the financial system.', "One of the Bank's main duties is to try to keep the cost of living stable. ", 'It has a target to keep inflation - the official measure of how quickly prices are rising - at 2%, but prices are <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-12196322" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">currently rising at about</a> five times that level.', "The Bank's traditional response to tackle rising inflation is to increase the UK's official interest rate, which influences the saving and borrowing rates charged by high street banks. ", 'In November, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-63471725" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">the Bank increased rates by 0.75 percentage point to 3%</a>, the highest level since 2008, when the UK banking system faced collapse.', 'It followed <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-62991376" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">an increase of 0.5 percentage points to 2.25% at its previous meeting in September</a>. At the time, it warned that further rises were likely. ', 'Putting up interest rates can mean people are more likely to save money, and less likely to borrow money. In theory this means they have less money to spend so will buy fewer things, which should help stop prices rising as quickly.', "Alternatively, if the Bank cuts interest rates, there's less incentive to save money and borrowing becomes cheaper. This can encourage people to go out and spend more, boosting the economy.", "After previously meeting every month to decide interest rate policy, the Bank's monetary policy committee (MPC) now convenes eight times a year to set rates.

', 'In the period from the 2009 financial crisis until 2021, the Bank of England bought £875bn of government bonds. This was done through a process called <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-15198789" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">quantitative easing</a> which was designed to reduce overall government borrowing costs, lower interest rates and stimulate spending in the economy.', 'The Bank announced an <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-63061614" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">emergency bond-buying programme</a> to try to stabilise the economy after September\'s mini-budget caused turmoil on financial markets.', 'This intervention has now ended, and the Bank is now going ahead with a plan first announced in August to sell off some of the government bonds it holds.', 'The Bank also:', 'Andrew Bailey <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-50861129" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">took over as governor in 2019,</a> having previously worked at the Bank for more than 30 years.
