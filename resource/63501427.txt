It has now reopened.', 'Helen Balfour read about the museum in <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-60010608" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">a BBC article</a>, and successfully applied to be an assistant on the island 8,000 miles (12,875km) away from her home.', 'The 23-year-old was attracted by her love of museums and heritage and her family ties to the island, as her grandfathers were whalers in the area.', 'The long land, sea and air journey to South Georgia took her three weeks.', '"I heard about the South Georgia museum first from an article that was written for the BBC and my dad saw it online and he sent it to me," she told BBC Radio Shetland.', '"And because of family connections to South Georgia I just found it very interesting.', '"My great-grandfather was here in the early 30s, and his sons - including my grandad - worked here. My other grandad was also here."', 'Helen got in touch with the team and asked if she could apply for a job, and successfully passed the interview.', 'Getting there involved taking the ferry from Shetland to Aberdeen, then the train to Oxford, a flight from Brize Norton to the Falklands, then another boat to South Georgia.

In 1904, Norwegians opened a whaling station there to process the whales' meat, blubber, and bones.", 'In the next 60 years, more than 175,000 whales were killed in the waters of South Georgia alone - processed at Grytviken and other stations along the shore.', 'But, by the 1960s, the industry had burned itself out - there were no longer enough whales to catch.', 'Grytviken was abandoned, but a relatively grand villa - built in 1914 - remained usable.', 'In 1989, David Wynn-Williams, a British Antarctic scientist, <a href="https://sgmuseum.gs/history/" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">suggested turning the villa into a museum</a>.

There\'s been a lot of nights where we\'ve all just been standing looking out the window looking at all the drama that goes on when the mums leave their pups behind," she explained.', '"We all carry broom handles just in case one of them gets a bit too close, they can be quite territorial.', '"They\'re a bit different from the seals that you would see in Shetland."', 'The new museum assistant is helping in the shop and with tours, and is looking forward to getting to know cruise ship passengers.', '"We\'re expecting thousands of visitors," she said.
