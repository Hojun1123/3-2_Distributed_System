He is also waiting for a container with 50 brand new bikes from France, though he says he has no idea when it will actually arrive. ', "And months ago, a local business asked him to repair some bicycles earmarked for donation to charity. That charity work is on hold because Mr Chaitowitz can't get hold of the components he needs.", 'Mr Chaitowitz has taken to sourcing spare parts where he can from local bike shops.

They also place heightened demand on resources at ports where they do call, says Dr Karamperidis. He argues that a greater number of medium-sized vessels could help to make supply chains more reliable in the future.', 'Marc Levinson, an economist and author of Outside the Box, a book about globalisation and container shipping, agrees that smaller ships are easier for ports to handle. ', 'Dr Levinson adds that businesses may also have to rethink their reliance on global supply chains that bring parts or products from single factories halfway round the world. This approach can be cheap but it relies on everything always functioning as intended.', '"The shipping crisis has really pointed out the riskiness of these kinds of business strategy," says Dr Levinson.', 'Ms George goes further and suggests that we may all have to have a rethink on our shopping habits. "I don\'t know where it\'s going to go," she says of the current situation. "But I do hope it goes more towards reduction of consumption."', "And in Cape Town, while Mr Chaitowitz entertains the idea of sourcing parts closer to home, to escape the ups and downs of international shipping, he admits that this probably isn't a realistic solution.", '"All of the little things that go in a bicycle are made so cheaply in Asia, I can\'t see, locally, how we would ever be able to compete," he says.
