', 'While renewable generation increased, there was also increased demand for electricity in Scotland during the first six months of 2022, following suppressed figures in 2021 due to Covid lockdowns. ', 'Average daily electricity demand increased to 77.3 GWh in the first half of the year, up 8% on the 2021 figure. ', 'The minister said wind power was already one of the cheapest forms of electricity and described expansion, supported by renewable technologies such as hydro power, as a "fantastic opportunity".', 'Mr Matheson said the plans would support a "fair and just" transition for the sector on the country\'s journey to becoming a "net-zero nation".', 'Fabrice Leveque, climate and energy policy manager at WWF Scotland, said: "It\'s great to see Scotland breaking records again for renewable power generation thanks to new power stations coming online and windy weather.', '"With sky high fossil fuel prices causing a cost-of-living crisis, renewable electricity is helping to lower energy bills and cut carbon pollution.', '"The challenge ahead is converting as much of our heating and transport to run on clean, home-grown renewables to protect us against volatile prices and climate change."', 'The national body which represents the sector said the figures showed Scotland was a "renewable energy powerhouse".', 'Nick Sharpe, director of communications and strategy at Scottish Renewables, said: "Scotland has an enormous renewable energy resource: our winds, waves, tides, rainfall and even our longer daylight hours are tremendous assets to the country, and renewable energy technologies enables us to use them to produce direct economic and environmental benefits.', '"Renewable electricity generation makes up the vast majority of Scotland\'s gross electricity consumption and in the last decade, we have more than tripled our renewable electricity output."', 'Mr Sharpe added the sector now employed more than 27,000 people and generated £5.6bn of output.', '© 2022 BBC.
