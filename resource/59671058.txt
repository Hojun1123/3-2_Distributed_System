We measure the difference in the gravitational pull, and we can then therefore mark the density changes in the subsurface."', 'The data is then processed and sold to clients, so "they can see what\'s underground", he added.', 'Julianne Sharples, international marketing manager, said they do surveys all over the world: "There is a lot of interest in Cornwall, from companies looking to fuel the green transition, help the country get to net zero, and looking for geothermal resources."', 'In recent years, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20201124-how-geothermal-lithium-could-revolutionise-green-energy" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Cornwall has been found to contain "globally significant" amounts of high-grade lithium</a>, a critical mineral for the production of batteries for electric vehicles, among other uses.', 'Granite beneath the surface also makes <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cornwall-46100763" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Cornwall suitable for geothermal energy exploration</a>, with two projects already established at United Downs and the Eden Project, and with four more planned.', 'Farmers, horse owners and parish councils have been contacted in advance to warn them of possible disruption from the flights.', 'The company said the plane would be much quieter than helicopters and other aircraft more commonly seen flying in Cornish skies.', 'Mr Searle said: "Our engines have upward facing exhausts, so the noise gets pushed upwards. ', '"So, when you have things like livestock in the area, it reduces the noise."', 'The noise was comparable to a car passing at 30mph, the company said.', 'The plane is taking off from and returning to Southampton each day due to a pre-existing arrangement and connection there, including the facilities and power supply required.', '<i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">Follow BBC News South West on </i><a href="https://twitter.com/BBCSpotlight" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Twitter</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">, </i><a href="https://www.facebook.com/bbcspotlight" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Facebook</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2"> and </i><a href="https://instagram.com/bbcspotlight" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Instagram</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">.
