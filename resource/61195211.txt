But others are less bothered - they\'re much more excited about the forthcoming release of Pinocchio.</b>', 'In the next four months, both Disney and Netflix will unleash their own versions of the classic tale about the boy whose nose grows when he lies.', "Disney's is a family-friendly, live-action remake, directed by Robert Zemeckis and starring Tom Hanks as Geppetto.", "Netflix's version, meanwhile, is a stop-motion animated film from Guillermo del Toro, the Oscar-winning director behind The Shape of Water. His will see Ewan McGregor star as Jiminy Cricket.", "Del Toro's film has taken a particularly long time to come to fruition. He announced his intention to make Pinocchio 14 years ago, but struggled to attract financing for the film and eventually announced its cancellation in 2017. ", 'However, the project was revived the following year when <a href="https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/guillermo-del-toro-brings-pinocchio-film-netflix/" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Netflix confirmed they were picking it up.</a>', 'It is sheer coincidence that it now finds itself colliding with Disney, which has in recent years been producing live-action remakes of some of its biggest historical hits - including Aladdin, Mulan and The Lion King.  ', "Of course, Pinocchio has been made for the screen several times since the classic 1940 original, which was adapted from the 1883 children's novel by Carlo Collodi.", 'But why does Hollywood so frequently release twin films - two movies that are not only about the same thing, but often released around the same time?', '"This phenomenon goes back decades," says film and awards season YouTuber Luke Hearfield. "There are numerous reasons for it, sometimes it really is just coincidence, two people having the same idea at the similar time. ', '"But I think now it\'s happening more than ever because we\'re living in the content era, more and more movies are being pumped out, so there\'s bound to be people having similar ideas."', '<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-43371881" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">We last wrote about this phenomenon in 2018,</a> following decades of examples, including Antz and A Bug\'s Life; Deep Impact and Armageddon; and Friends With Benefits and No Strings Attached.', 'But plenty more examples have sprung up recently, and they just keep coming.', 'Often, real-life news events spark a rush in producers wanting to tell a story on screen. <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-44791998" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">The 2018 Thai cave rescue</a> prompted two dramatisations (The Cave and Thirteen Lives) and a documentary (The Rescue).', '"Steve Jobs died and we saw two Jobs movies come out - one directed by Joshua Michael Stern and one by Danny Boyle," recalls Hearfield.', 'Other times, he notes, it might be due to a significant anniversary. "When we hit the centenary of World War One, we started getting more and more films about it, such as They Shall Not Grow Old, 1917, The Light Between Oceans, even DC\'s Wonder Woman was set during the war."', 'But while it\'s possible for two studios to be working on similar films accidentally, on other occasions, they deliberately compete with one another. "Sometimes it is a race between production companies, when they know there is something that people will be interested to watch, there\'s a sense of who can churn it out first."', 'There are several cases where both the films are successful at the box office. But other times, one film becomes so huge, the public is barely aware of the other. ', '"Sometimes there\'s one that wins and one that has a more beloved fanbase or stands the test of time better," Hearfield says, adding that this can be down to a lack of funding and marketing.', 'But, he adds, clashes aren\'t necessarily a problem. "I\'m still a sucker for A Bug\'s Life and Antz - I actually really liked both those movies a lot! I was a kid when they both came out, but I didn\'t really notice the similarities as a child. They\'re both about insects, but they\'re different stories, and both were enjoyable.
