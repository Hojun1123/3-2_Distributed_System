Not always. ', "And that's because gift wrap often contains much more than simply paper. ", '"It\'s a nightmare for paper mills this time of year," confesses Simon Ellin, the chief executive of the Recycling Association - a trade body that represents around 90 different paper merchants, waste management companies and other businesses involved in recycling paper. ', "That's because while they're presented with mountains of wrapping paper, they cannot work with all of it.", '"Not all wrapping paper is paper," Simon points out. Some is plastic-based.
