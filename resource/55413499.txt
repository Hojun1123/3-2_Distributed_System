['<b class="ssrcss-hmf8ql-BoldText e5tfeyi3">Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has announced the repeal of three agricultural laws that had led to year-long protests by farmers.</b>', 'However, farmers say they will continue to protest until other demands are met, including guaranteed minimum prices for their produce and increased wages.', "Leaders from the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) said the new farms laws would double farmers' income - a promise originally made by Mr Modi in 2016.", 'So is there any sign of rural livelihoods improving?', "Around 40% of India's workforce is engaged in agriculture, according to the World Bank.", 'The average monthly income of agricultural households rose 59% in absolute terms between 2012 and 2019, according to official data.', "However, it's worth noting that the most recent data for that period includes an additional source of income not factored in to earlier estimates. ", 'Also, rising inflation has eaten into real wages. After adjusting for inflation, incomes grew only by 16% in real terms over that period.', 'In 2018, <a href="http://www.oecd.org/officialdocuments/publicdisplaydocumentpdf/?cote=TAD/CA(2018)4/FINAL&amp;docLanguage=En" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">a report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)</a> estimated that farmers\' incomes increased by just 2% a year in real terms between 2013 and 2016.', "The report also made clear that these farmers' incomes were just one-third of those for non-agricultural households.", "Agricultural policy expert Devinder Sharma believes farmers' incomes in real terms have remained stagnant or even declined for several decades.", '"An increase of a couple of thousand [rupees] a month doesn\'t make much difference if we account for inflation," he says.', 'He also points to the rising costs that farmers face, as well as the wildly fluctuating prices they receive for their produce.', "It's also worth adding that in recent years, there have been periods of extreme weather such as droughts, which have seriously affected rural livelihoods.", 'In 2017, a government committee reported that incomes for farmers would need to grow by 10.4% each year from 2015 for them to double by 2022.', "That's not been happening.", 'It also said the government needed to invest 6.39bn rupees (£64bn; $86bn) in the agricultural sector.', 'Data on both public and private investment shows it has been falling for most of the period between 2013 and 2019.', 'In 2011-12, investment in agriculture as a percentage of total investment stood at 8.5%.
