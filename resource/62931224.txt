"But as normal bodies are tested and the cause of death determined, I would expect there to be also evidence of torture and executions, because it follows a pattern of what\'s been happening in the occupied territories."', '<i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">Additional reporting by Alys Davies, BBC News.</i>', 'World Cup winner Jürgen Klinsmann invites you to subscribe to his daily World Cup newsletter.', '© 2022 BBC.
