', 'They were able to incorporate these sensors into a scanner design that can be worn as a helmet allowing people to move freely.', 'It said the team had been working on the project since 2015 and that the system could be adapted for all ages, from newborns to adults.', 'Prof Matt Brookes, who leads MEG research at the university, said: "The work that Elena, Ryan and Niall have done is genuinely ground-breaking, with far-reaching implications for healthcare.', '"Individually, they are exceptional scientists, but working together they have achieved something that is truly and uniquely special."', 'The awards celebrate physicists at every stage of their career.', 'Institute of Physics president Prof Sheila Rowan said: "On behalf of the Institute of Physics, I warmly congratulate all of this year\'s award winners.', '"Each and every one of them has made a significant and positive impact in their profession."', '<i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">Follow BBC East Midlands on </i><a href="https://www.facebook.com/bbceastmids/" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Facebook</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">, on </i><a href="https://twitter.com/bbcemt" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Twitter</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">, or on </i><a href="https://www.instagram.com/bbceastmidlands/" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Instagram</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">.
