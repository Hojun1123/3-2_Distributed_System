', 'They are acting very differently now, with most people on those variable tariffs - protecting people from short-term fluctuations, but giving them a clear view of what will be passed on by energy suppliers from October, and again in January.', 'The other rising prices, for around 700 goods and services widely checked each month by the Office for National Statistics, show that it is food that has been driving the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-62562025" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">faster rate of inflation</a> between June and July.', 'That category sees prices up 12.7% in the past year, and across every category.
