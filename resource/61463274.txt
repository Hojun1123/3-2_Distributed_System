But it\'s too early to say, there\'s clearly going to be an economic downturn, there\'s some fear of recession and in a recession the lowest-cost provider, which in the UK and in Europe is Ryanair, will do better, but will do better because we can sustain lower prices."', 'In its results the airline stated customers were still booking their trips later than usual and said the "booking curve" looked more like pre-Covid times.', 'Ryanair said traffic recovered strongly as it carried 97.1 million guests, up from just 27.5 million the year before thanks to the lifting of pandemic restrictions.', 'It said it hopes to boost this further to 165 million passengers this year - ahead of the 149 million record level seen pre-Covid.', 'Elsewhere, Holiday giant Tui has said it expects summer bookings to "almost reach" 2019 levels this year, but <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-61405632" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">warned there will be "no last minute" deals.</a>', '"There will be practically no last minute offers at low prices this summer," said Fritz Joussen, Tui\'s chief executive.', 'Mr O\'Leary said he hoped to see "pinch points" at UK airports such as Manchester or Heathrow eliminated by the end of June in time for the peak summer period. ', 'He said: "There\'s no doubt I think getting through airports this summer is going to be challenging and we\'re encouraging all of our customers to show up earlier and allow more time to get through airport security". ', 'However he claimed this was less the case at other airports Ryanair uses, such as Glasgow, Stansted, and Bristol.', "He said Ryanair didn't face the same recruitment challenges as some competitors because it had kept people on.
