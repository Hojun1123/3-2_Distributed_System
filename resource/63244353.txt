', 'Only one in five of the longest-standing weather stations in the UK has a temperature record that was set before 2000. ', 'The remaining 80% were all set in the past two decades.', 'Leuchars station in Fife was the northernmost of the long-standing stations to set a record in 2022. Its previous high set in 1990 was beaten by 0.5C.', 'Gogerddan, near Aberystwyth, was the first location in Wales to break the previous national record of 35.2C that had stood for more than 30 years.

This only happened on five occasions in the 90 years prior.', "And the UK's record temperatures have been broken more regularly in recent years. ", 'While the 1911 record of 36.7C held for 79 years, subsequent records stood for less than two decades.
