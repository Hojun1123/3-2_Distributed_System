Low-income farmers may be grappling with too little fertiliser, not too much.', 'But overall, substantially more fertiliser is being added to fields than is needed - increasing costs and environmental damage.', 'Overuse "is a huge challenge in our field," says Bhupinder Farmaha, a nutrient management specialist at Clemson University in the US, as well as an agricultural extension agent who works with farmers like Ms Sharp.', 'Overuse is due in part to tradition, and in part to outdated recommendations for fertiliser application that does not take account of specific environmental conditions.', 'Sri Lanka came up with a radical solution to the problem: the government abruptly banned chemical fertilisers in April 2021.

Farmers who had depended on chemical fertilisers were suddenly scrambling for organic alternatives, with little time to prepare.', 'Very few Sri Lankan farmers were accustomed to organic fertilisers, which in any case were in short supply.', 'While the ban was eased in November 2021, Sri Lankan agriculture and the economy are still feeling the shocks.

"Not every place in the field needs the same prescription," she explains. "I think that\'s where Daddy and I differ. He\'s used to just putting out the same amount because that\'s what they did for years and years."', 'Another way to reduce the use of chemical fertilisers would be to adopt farming methods that improve the quality of soil.', '<a href="https://www.ctc-n.org/technologies/conservation-tillage" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Conservation tillage</a>, where the soil is disturbed as little as possible, and the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/use-cover-crops-or-green-manure" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">use of cover crops</a> like ryegrass can enhance fertility while reducing the climate impacts of agriculture.', 'Crop rotation can contribute to soil health as well. Ms Sharp says that on her farm; "We try to plan our crop rotation in a way where the crop we\'re planning on planting uses the nutrients from the previous crop."', 'There is also a renewed interest in organic fertilisers.', "Leigh Ann Winowiecki, a soil systems scientist at the research organisation CIFOR-ICRAF in Nairobi, Kenya, says farmyard manure has a host of benefits: providing nutrients to the plants, improving soil structure, and increasing the soil's ability to hold water. ", '"Our research has also shown that inputs of compost and composted farmyard manure increases the effectiveness of synthetic fertilisers," reports Ms Winowiecki.', 'She says that in eastern Kenya it could be a practical solution as "most farmers have at least one cow near the homestead".', 'While compost and manure can be effective soil supplements, Dr Dharmakeerthi questions whether they can replace nitrogen-based fertilisers altogether, due to their lower levels of vital nutrients.', 'It will be very difficult to move away from the world\'s current dependence on these high-yielding chemical fertilisers, particularly to grow enough animal feed to satisfy <a href="https://www.vaclavsmil.com/wp-content/uploads/docs/smil-article-worldagriculture.pdf" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">the growing global demand for meat</a>.', 'An additional problem is the availability of organic fertilisers. Ms Sharp reports that chicken litter is an effective fertiliser but has been hard to source this year. Where it was available, prices were about 200% higher than last year.', 'It also smells bad. "The people around town hate it, because it stinks to high heaven," says Ms Sharp.', 'A different kind of <a href="https://oceaninnovationchallenge.org/ocean-innovations/nutrialgae-novel-sustainable-algae-based-fertilizers" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">beneficial organism is algae</a>, which for centuries has been used to enhance crops. The marine biotech company Ficosterra is seeking to update this tradition, and is currently trialling algae-based fertilisers produced in Spain and Mexico. ', 'It also extracts nutrients from a seaweed called Macrocystis Piryfera, that grows in dense forests along the American Pacific coast and sells that as a fertiliser.', 'For his part, Dr Dharmakeerthi sees great potential in organic waste, such as fermented fish waste. "That is the best alternative," he says.', 'The challenge is to develop technologies to extract the nutrients in a cost effective way, he says.', 'One positive aspect of the current fertiliser crisis is soaring interest in ecologically friendly and widely available types of fertiliser. "Because of this scarcity there will be a big research boom," Dr Dharmakeerthi predicts. ', 'Back in South Carolina, Ms Sharp has turned to waste ash produced at a local paper mill. All she had to pay for were transport costs. ', '"It actually changed the pH in our favour by about a percent," Ms Sharp reports. "That\'s not going to take the place of a potash or a chicken litter, but it does take the sting out of the prices."', 'World Cup winner Jürgen Klinsmann invites you to subscribe to his daily World Cup newsletter.', '© 2022 BBC.
