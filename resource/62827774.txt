Apple says the data on its devices will be encrypted and only accessible via a passcode or biometrics. ', '"We are taking our commitment to women\'s health even further," said Jeff Williams, chief operating officer at Apple.', 'Apple said a new automatic retrospective ovulation notification could help those who are trying to conceive. ', 'If activated, the new watch can monitor body temperate every five seconds overnight, and detect tiny changes which can signal ovulation. ', 'Another new feature is car crash detection. Using sensors, the watch will be able to identify a severe crash and will automatically connect its wearer with emergency services, provide their exact location and notify emergency contacts.

The phone will display the whereabouts of passing satellites overhead and demonstrate how to point the device at them correctly. ', 'It can take from 15 seconds to a few minutes to send a basic message.', '"The investment to add satellite capability should not be underestimated," said Ben Wood, chief analyst at CCS Insight. ', '"It will likely have taken Apple years to put all the pieces of the puzzle in place, including a commercial agreement with satellite provider Globalstar, and the creation of the infrastructure needed to pass messages to the emergency services."', 'Tech analyst Paolo Pescatore said he believed the innovation was good news for consumers "in hard-to-reach areas". ', '"It is encouraging to see providers starting to get serious about using satellite - ultimately reliable and robust connectivity is still highly sought-after among all users," he said.', 'The tech giant announced a new 12-megapixel camera, capable of taking photos of fast-moving subjects, and the company claims a 49% improvement in low-light capturing. ', 'The front camera also included auto-focus for the first time, to help sharpen selfies.', 'According to Apple, iPhone users took more than three trillion photos in the last 12 months.', 'The iPhone 14 is priced from $799 (US), £849 (UK).', 'The biggest change in iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max design is the top of the screen which is now a pill shaped cut-out.', 'A feature called the Dynamic Island has replaced the black notch, which many iPhone users complain about - and it can change shape depending on what notifications there are.', 'The other big change is that the handset can always remain on.', 'When the phone is not in use, the screen dims and the refresh rate is lowered.

But nothing was announced today that is going to revolutionise the tech industry.', 'Much of Apple\'s new tech seems ideal if you find yourself in some kind of peril on a regular basis.  The new iPhone 14 will be able to send texts by satellite when off the grid. The Ultra Watch design is chunky with extra-long battery life - the company says this is perfect for multi-day remote trips. Apple also announced a new crash detection system on new watches and phones, which will alert the emergency services when it detects an impact. The strategy here is pretty clear. Apple is continuing to pitch its hardware as a health and safety aid. Not surprisingly, Tim Cook describes the products as "essential".', 'But in reality these are interesting but fairly niche updates - features that users will hope they will never have to use.', 'World Cup winner Jürgen Klinsmann invites you to subscribe to his daily World Cup newsletter.', '© 2022 BBC.
