It was breached so the government introduced a ban.', 'In 2019, the company Cuadrilla Resources caused a magnitude-2.9 earthquake at its Preston New Road site in Lancashire. Existing rules require fracking to be halted if a tremor measuring 0.5 magnitude or above is caused.', 'It came after a previous suspension on fracking which lasted a year in November 2011 during the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government.', 'The BBC has been told the BSG report will outline the current "state of play" of what the science says about fracking and its seismic risk.', 'It is expected to say that there is currently only a limited understanding of UK geology and onshore shale resources.', 'The report will not attempt to "justify" fracking, but will outline what more data may be needed.', 'Labour sources have told the BBC the party intended to accuse the government on Thursday of "shifting the goal posts" on what is considered an acceptable risk level associated with fracking.', 'The party opposes more fracking, arguing that it would not bring down the cost of gas and energy, be good for the climate, or be popular with the public.', "Labour have instead called for planning rules to be relaxed in England around certain renewables such as onshore wind, which the government Department for Business's public attitudes research has suggested is more popular with the public than fracking.", 'Multiple Tory MPs - including some cabinet ministers - have previously expressed opposition to fracking.', 'In March, Mr Kwarteng said that lifting the ban on fracking would "take up to a decade to extract sufficient volumes" of gas at a "high cost for communities and our precious countryside".', 'He also argued it would not lower the European price of gas because private companies would not sell the gas they produce below the market price.', 'Â© 2022 BBC.
