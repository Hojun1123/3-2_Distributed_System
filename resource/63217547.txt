", '"It\'s imperative we do everything in our power to protect our harrier population and the large tracts of wild, open land on which they depend," Mr Morris said.', '"The Isle of Man is internationally recognised as a stronghold for this bird of prey, and we have a duty to keep it that way."', 'Even a small future decline in the future could see the species classified as under extreme threat due to its small range and dependence on undisturbed, quality habitat, he added.', '<i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">Why not follow BBC Isle of Man on </i><a href="https://en-gb.facebook.com/bbcisleofman/" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Facebook</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2"> and </i><a href="https://twitter.com/BBCIsleofMan" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Twitter</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">?
