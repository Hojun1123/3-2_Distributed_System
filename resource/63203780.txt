['<b class="ssrcss-hmf8ql-BoldText e5tfeyi3">The National Audit Office (NAO) is to examine the delivery and value for money of the Unboxed festival.</b>', 'It comes after the chair of a parliamentary committee <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-62658750" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">called for an investigation into the £120m arts festival</a>, criticising it as an "excessive waste of money".', 'The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said: "We do not agree with the select committee\'s views."', 'Unboxed was announced in 2018 by then prime minister Theresa May. ', 'The UK-wide free event, which began in March and will run until November, features 10 projects highlighting science, technology, engineering, the arts and mathematics.', 'But the government\'s "celebration of creativity" was soon dubbed the Festival of Brexit, and has since had its visitor numbers questioned.', "In late August, an article published in parliament's The House magazine claimed suggested there had been fewer than 240,000 visitors, despite a proposed target of 66 million.", 'However Unboxed told the BBC on Tuesday that "the numbers reported misrepresent the public engagement with Unboxed, and reflect attendance at only eight of the 107 physical locations from within the programme".

"And actually even within the department [it] was something that effectively they felt as if it was going off the rails. But no-one said, \'Stop, let\'s reassess. And if necessary, let\'s cancel.\'"', 'However the DCMS responded by saying Unboxed had "helped open up access to arts and culture across the country with an inclusive and ground-breaking programme of live and digital events, designed to bring people together and delivered in partnership with the devolved nations of the UK.".', 'Unboxed added that its commissions have been presented in "more than 100 towns, cities and villages, engaged millions across live and digital and employed thousands of creatives around the UK".
