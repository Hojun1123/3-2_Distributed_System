', 'When pressed by coroner Andrew Walker to clarify whether she thought the posts were safe, she replied "Yes, it is safe".', 'She said Meta\'s understanding was there was no clear research into the effect posts have on children but their research reported a "mixed experience".', 'Questioning why Instagram felt it could choose which material was safe for children to view, the coroner then asked: "So why are you given the entitlement to assist children in this way?', '"Who has given you the permission to do this? You run a business.', '"There are a great many people who are ... trained medical professionals. What gives you the right to make the decisions about the material to put before children?"', 'Ms Lagone responded: "That\'s why we work closely with experts."', 'She added decisions were not "made in a vacuum".', 'During the day\'s proceedings, videos the teenager accessed on Instagram were played to the court with the coroner once again warning the material had the "potential to cause great harm".', 'He said the content "seeks to romanticise and in some way validate the act of harm to young people", before urging anyone who wanted to leave the room to do so, with one person leaving.', 'When shown a note on Molly\'s phone which used the words "I just want to be pretty", Mr Sanders said the language was identical to a post the teenager had viewed on Instagram two days before.', '"It\'s identical language... this is Instagram literally giving Molly ideas that she need to be concerned about her weight, correct?" Mr Sanders asked.', 'Ms Lagone replied: "I can\'t speak about what Molly may have been thinking."', 'Referring to all the material viewed by the teenager the family considered to be "encouraging" suicide or self-harm, Mr Sanders continued: "Do you agree with us that this type of material is not safe for children?"', 'Ms Lagone said policies were in place for all users and described the posts viewed by the court as a "cry for help".', 'Soon after the inquest began, Molly\'s father <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-62981964" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Ian Russell said he had been shocked</a> by the "dark, graphic, harmful material" available for children to view online.', 'Mr Russell told the inquest much of the content seemed to "normalise" self-harm and suicide.', 'On Thursday, Pinterest\'s head of community operations, Judson Hoffman, apologised after <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-62991510" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0"> admitting the platform was "not safe</a>" when the 14-year-old used it.', 'The inquest continues.', '<i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">If you\'ve been affected by </i><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/2NfvF9kvC5N1nFllK9XzBWS/information-and-support-self-harm" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">self-harm</a> or <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/4WLs5NlwrySXJR2n8Snszdg/emotional-distress-information-and-support" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">emotional distress</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">, help and support is available via </i><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/actionline" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">the BBC Action Line</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">.</i>', 'Follow BBC London on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BBCLondon" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/BBCLondonNews" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Twitter </a>and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bbclondon/?hl=en" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Instagram</a>.
