Being stationary for any period of time is completely unnatural to them.', '"We\'re going to have to do a lot of work to maintain the high level of animal welfare they\'re used to.', '"Wild birds are bringing this in and it\'s very reductionist thinking to think we can just keep locking birds down for months and months at a time - more than half the year - and not expect there to be a negative impact on animal welfare and nutrient density of what we\'re trying to produce, which is fantastic free-range eggs.', '"So I\'d like to know what the plan is for the longer term, because we can\'t keep doing this."', 'Vicky Sewell runs a branch of chicken rescue charity Fresh Start for Hens, based in Watton, Norfolk.', "Its Facebook members heard the news of Defra's proposed housing measures on Friday night and have since been sharing concerns and advice about how best to adhere to the rules.", '"Lots of people let their hens run free, but after 10 years I\'ve learned it\'s best to give them somewhere secure and sheltered as well," she says.', 'Very fine mesh that does not allow wild bird droppings to seep through can be used to cover runs, she says, but it is better with a secure tarpaulin.', '"Hens bring such enjoyment, it\'s worth the investment."', 'However, the prospect of keeping hers cooped up for months is not one she relishes.', 'Enrichment of their surroundings is paramount to keeping the captive chickens content, she says.', '"They\'re very active and interactive, and they quickly sort out who\'s where in the pecking order.', '"If they get bored they can peck at their own feathers or bully each other."
