He was not, however, charged with Amanda's death.", 'The 13-year sentence handed down on Friday will begin after the term imposed by the Dutch court has expired, said the British Columbia Prosecution Service.', 'Coban showed no remorse in court in New Westminster as he learned his fate.', 'Amanda killed herself five weeks after uploading her widely watched YouTube video, and after explicit photos of her were leaked online.', 'Coban harassed the girl for nearly three years online using 22 separate fake social media accounts.
