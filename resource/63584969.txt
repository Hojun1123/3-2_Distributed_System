', '"We are just happy that he seems to be thriving and surviving thus far," she added.', 'Diane Bennett of Forestry and Land Scotland, Tweed Valley Osprey Project, said Glen had settled in Rio Anllóns in northwest Spain after he hitched a ride but seemed to have no desire to go further south.', '"During September he had extensively explored along the whole of the river system there and it seems that he is thriving," she said.', '"He is now familiar with the area, he has been finding suitable fishing and roosting areas and all seems to have been going well for the whole month. ', '"It is possible that Glen may remain in Spain during the winter months but it\'s out of the normal - in that most birds would head further south."', 'She said he appeared to be "content to stay" where he was but had gone on an apparent scouting mission.', '"In the past 10 days Glen left the area and has made a long familiarisation trip all the way along the coast and down to Portugal before returning north to the Rio Anllóns again," she said.', '"If the weather becomes more adverse in northern Spain at Anllóns as winter progresses, then Glen now has some knowledge of where he can go, further south and this is a good thing. ', '"The fascinating thing I feel, is that question of whether it is a deliberate decision to make an exploratory trip and why - or is it a random wander?"', '<b class="ssrcss-hmf8ql-BoldText e5tfeyi3">You can find out more about the migration of Scotland\'s ospreys on </b><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m001ddnd" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Flight of the Ospreys on BBC Radio 4 every Tuesday at 09:30.</a>', '© 2022 BBC.
