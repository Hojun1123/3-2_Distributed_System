', 'In fact, they can end up taking home a smaller proportion of an extra £1 earned than someone earning £150,000 a year.', 'Here, are five examples of workers paying very high effective tax rates. ', 'Before the chancellor cut the taper rate, a universal credit claimant earning £9,000 a year from a part-time job would be taking home 37p of an extra £1 earned.', 'Now, that rises to 45p - but that is still the equivalent of a pretty high tax rate.', 'Now consider an employee, for example a parent, earning enough to pay income tax - so at least £12,570 a year - but still entitled to universal credit.', 'Even with the lower taper rate, they are still taking home only 31p of an extra £1 earned.', 'The taper rate is applied after income tax and National Insurance have been paid, which is why, in this example, it is taking 37p of an extra £1 earned and not 55p.', 'Income tax rates and bands are slightly different <a href="https://www.mygov.scot/income-tax-rates-and-personal-allowances" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">in Scotland</a>. There is a 19% starter rate for income tax between earnings of £12,570 and £14,667.

', 'It is £21.15 a week for the first child and £14 a week for each additional child.', 'But the benefit is withdrawn gradually for those earning between £50,000 and £60,000.', 'Consider someone with three children, earning £50,500 a year. ', 'The loss of child benefit means for an extra £1 earned, they take home 32p.', 'The higher rate of income tax in Scotland is 41%, so our worker with three children, earning £50,500, would keep 31p of an extra £1 earned.', 'In Scotland, people start paying the 41% higher rate of income tax when they are earning £43,663 a year.', 'In the rest of the UK, they start paying a 40% higher rate at £50,271 a year. ', 'But National Insurance rates are the same throughout the UK, which means a worker in Scotland earning between £43,663 and £50,271 would be paying both the higher rate of income tax and the 12% higher rate of National Insurance at the same time, meaning they take home only 47p of an extra £1 earned.', 'In the rest of the UK, employees earning that much would be paying only 20% income tax, so would take home 68p of an extra £1 earned - 21p more than their Scottish counterparts.', 'People do not have to start paying income tax until they are earning more than £12,570 a year.', 'This is called the personal allowance.', 'But the personal allowance is withdrawn at a rate of £1 of allowance for every extra £2 earned above £100,000.', 'So those earning more than £100,000 a year start paying tax on part of their earnings they did not previously have to pay tax on.', 'And this means someone earning between £100,000 and £125,140 a year would take home 38p of an extra £1 earned. In Scotland, it would be 37p.', 'All of these people are taking home less of an extra £1 earned than somebody earning more than £150,000 and paying what is supposedly the top rate of tax.', 'That person would take home 53p of an extra £1 earned.', 'Bear in mind all of these figures are the current rates - National Insurance rates will be rising in April.', 'We asked the Treasury why some workers pay much higher rates of tax than people earning considerably more but have not received a reply. ', 'In all the examples above, somebody earning an extra £1 still gets to keep some of this extra money - but there are situations in which earning an extra £1 could actually make someone worse off overall. These are known as cliff edges.', 'For example, if you earn less than £50,270 and your husband, wife or civil partner earns less than £12,570, they can use <a href="https://www.gov.uk/marriage-allowance" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">marriage allowance</a> to transfer £1,260 of their income tax personal allowance to you.', 'That would mean you no longer needed to pay income tax on £1,260 of your earnings, saving you £252 a year.', 'But if you earned an extra £1, putting you on £50,271, you would no longer be eligible for marriage allowance, leaving you almost £252 a year worse off.', 'In Scotland, the cliff edge would be at £43,662 a year.', 'Cliff edges also occur with other schemes, including the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/apply-tax-free-interest-on-savings" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">personal savings allowance</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/tax-free-childcare" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">tax-free childcare</a>.', '<i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">The comparable tax rate for somebody outside Scotland earning £44,000 a year was corrected. </i>', '<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-41928747" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?
