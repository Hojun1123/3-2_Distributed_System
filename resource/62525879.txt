", "Speaking to BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme, Mr Carson said the decision would affect many people who tuned in. ", '"Being registered blind, and a few weeks ago I had a significant drop in my sight loss where I am now almost totally blind and I now rely on audio for a lot of things," he told BBC\'s Evening Extra programme.', '"It\'s extremely disappointing. It\'s more than disappointing, it\'s quite upsetting for an awful lot of people who would be listening," he added.', 'He said that when he heard the news he "couldn\'t get his head around it".

', 'Mr Carson said there was a lot of nostalgia and tradition around the results. ', '"There\'s a traditional thing attached, I\'m from the James Alexander Gordon days in the past, I know football has changed in terms of different TV kick-offs but when you look at 15:00 on a Saturday there is a vast amount of matches.
