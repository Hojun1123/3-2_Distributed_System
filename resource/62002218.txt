", 'The US systems are M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System or Himars.', 'Crucially, the range of Himars, and many other systems, varies according to the munitions used, and it is believed that western donors have not provided the ammunition with the longest range.', 'The munitions thought to have been supplied to Ukraine give the system a range of about 50 miles (80km), further than the Smerch system on the Russian side.', 'Himars is also much more accurate than the equivalent Russian systems. ', 'At the start of July, Australia, Canada and the US had also sent more than 100 M777 howitzers and 300,000 rounds of 155mm ammunition to Ukraine.', "The range of the M777 is similar to Russia's Giatsint-B howitzer, and much longer than Russia's  D-30 towed gun.", "Ukraine's own Warsaw Pact-designed artillery uses 152mm shells. ", 'But with stocks running low, Ukraine is shifting to the Nato-configured 155mm ammunition.
