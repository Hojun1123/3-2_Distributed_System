Those suppliers often provided the rebate on a first come, first served basis.', 'As energy bills started to rise, the government said the system would be reformed, extended and made more generous. Further promises of larger <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-61592496" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">cost-of-living payments</a> followed when the price of energy continued to soar.', 'Between now and March, £150 will automatically be taken off electricity bills by the vast majority of energy suppliers for anyone who is eligible.

', 'However, charities National Energy Action (NEA) and Scope said that 500,000 households across England and Wales that were previously eligible will now be ruled out. ', 'That is because Disability Living Allowance and Personal Independence Payments are no longer qualifying benefits. People on low incomes, who do not receive means-tested benefits and who live in smaller, newer, houses, will also be among those losing out.', 'Adam Scorer, chief executive of NEA, said: "Removing a £150 rebate from these vulnerable groups is unwelcome and an unnecessary change to a vital programme - especially during an energy crisis."   ', 'James Taylor, director of strategy at Scope, described the decision as "shameful" when disabled people were worried about the cost of running equipment such as breathing machines and powered wheelchairs. ', '"Life costs a lot more when you\'re disabled. The government needs to provide more direct financial support now, not less, so disabled people don\'t freeze and starve this winter," he warned.', 'The criteria differs in the various parts of Britain. The discount is not available in Northern Ireland, although some other grants may be provided to those finding it difficult to pay bills.', 'A statement from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: "We have introduced an unprecedented package of energy bills support for low-income households worth £1,200, as well as the £400 energy bill rebate and the Price Guarantee scheme, which will save the typical household around £700 this winter.', '"On top of this, we are also prioritising households most in need this winter, with over three million homes across Great Britain receiving an additional £150 energy bill rebate through the Warm Home Discount, which will mean an extra 780,000 pensioners and low-income families will benefit this year compared to last."', 'The Warm Home Discount is different to the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/winter-fuel-payment" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Winter Fuel Payment</a> which is paid to pensioners by 13 January, and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/cold-weather-payment" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Cold Weather Payments</a> when there are periods of freezing weather, or <a href="https://www.mygov.scot/cold-weather-payment-is-changing" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Winter Heating Payments</a> in Scotland.', '© 2022 BBC.
