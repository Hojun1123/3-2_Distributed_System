['<b class="ssrcss-hmf8ql-BoldText e5tfeyi3">A scheme to cut the energy bills of people in fuel poverty in Wales has failed to reach many of those now needing help, politicians have said.</b>', 'A Senedd inquiry report said the <a href="https://gov.wales/get-help-energy-efficiency-households" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Warm Homes Programme</a> lacked the "scale, size and purpose" to meet people\'s needs.', 'Labour\'s Jenny Rathbone, who led the inquiry, called the programme "in many ways a failure", as ministers warned <a href="https://gov.wales/written-statement-fuel-poverty" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">45% of Wales\' households</a> could be in fuel poverty by the winter.', 'Welsh ministers welcomed the report.', 'The Welsh government defines fuel poverty as when people have to spend more than 10% of their income to heat their home properly.', 'Household budgets are facing huge pressure with rising inflation and hikes in energy prices a major factor.', 'UK inflation, the rate at which prices are rising, jumped to 9% in the 12 months to April, up from 7% in March - <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-61483175" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">the highest rate for 40 years</a> - and is expected to continue to rise this year.', 'Last month, typical energy bills in Britain rose from £1,277 to £1,971, after <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-61078975" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">regulator Ofgem raised the price cap</a> and are forecast to jump a further 32% when the cap goes up again in October.', 'Michelle Hopkins, from Swansea, is a full time carer for her husband Stephen, who is bipolar, and she shared her experiences as part of the evidence the committee considered.

And depending whether it\'s sunny, I take them to the laundrette.

I can\'t let myself slip into that darkness really because I\'ve got to try to make ends meet and I know it\'s going to get worse."', "Carol Beaumont, 75, from Newport, has seen her monthly energy and water bills rise by £71. She says the rising cost of food, energy and fuel means she's no longer enjoying life like she used to.  ", 'She says her social life is "non-existent", and has had to completely change the way she lives due to rising costs. ', '"In this day and age I think it\'s disgraceful that politicians are letting us live like this because it\'s not getting any better it\'s getting worse," she said.

I try not to cook too much on the stove, I can just put it in the microwave, so I am changing the way I\'m doing things."', '"In the shower I\'m in, run the water round me twice, and I\'m out, because that takes a lot of electric," Carol added.', '"You live your life differently even just to three months ago. You\'re conscious of what you\'re spending and I\'ve never had to live like that', '"I used to enjoy going to the shops, having a look to see if there was anything there, a new blouse of a new pair of shoes.
