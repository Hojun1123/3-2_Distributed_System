['<b class="ssrcss-hmf8ql-BoldText e5tfeyi3">The UK could be set for its longest recession since records began, the Bank of England has warned. </b>', 'So what exactly does that mean?  ', "In normal times, a country's economy grows. ", 'Its citizens, on average, become slightly richer as the value of the goods and services it produces - its <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-13200758" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Gross Domestic Product (GDP)</a> - increases.', 'But sometimes this value falls, and a recession is usually defined as when this happens for two three-month periods - or quarters - in a row. ', "When this happens, it's a sign the economy is doing badly.", 'The last time the UK went into recession was <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-53748278" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">in 2020</a>, at the height of the coronavirus pandemic.', 'The latest data from the Office for National Statistics indicates that <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-63582201" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">the UK economy shrank by 0.2%</a> in the three months from July to September. ', 'If the economy shrinks again in the following three-month period to December, then the UK will officially be in recession.', 'The Bank of England says it expects that to happen.', 'It has warned that the UK <a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetary-policy-report/2022/november-2022" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">"is expected to be in recession for a prolonged period"</a> - throughout 2023 and the first half of 2024.', "The Bank of England blames the UK's economic problems on very sharp increases in prices, especially for energy and food. ", "People's incomes are falling after adjusting for rising prices. Inflation - the rate at which prices are rising - rose to 10.1% in September. ", 'The Bank believes inflation will "fall sharply to some way below the 2% target in two years\' time, and further below the target in three years\' time". ', 'For most people, economic growth is good. ', 'It usually means there are more jobs. Companies are more profitable and can pay employees and shareholders more. ', 'The higher wages and larger profits seen in a growing economy also generate more money for the government in taxes. ', "That means it can spend more on benefits, public services and government workers' wages, or it can cut taxes.", 'When the economy shrinks, all these things go into reverse.', 'Other economies are also struggling, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).', 'However, the UK is bottom of the G7 group of leading industrial nations for economic growth.  ', "The BBC's economics editor, Faisal Islam, has pointed to factors including the UK's dependence on imported gas and a shortage of workers.", 'Globally, the IMF says economic activity is slowing down more quickly then expected and inflation rates are higher than they have been for several decades. ', "This is partly blamed on Russia's war in Ukraine, which has increased energy prices and food prices.", 'There are also continuing effects from the Covid pandemic.', 'Some people may lose their jobs, and unemployment could rise. Graduates and school leavers could find it harder to get their first job. ', 'Others may find it harder to be promoted, or to get big enough pay rises to keep pace with price increases. ', 'However, the pain of a recession is typically not felt equally across society, and inequality can increase. ', 'Benefit recipients and those on fixed incomes are particularly likely to struggle. ', 'When the economy is struggling to grow at the same time as there is high inflation, there is a situation called "stagflation", which is very difficult to solve.', 'When a country is in a recession, the Bank of England - which is independent of government - would usually be expected to cut interest rates. ', 'This makes it cheaper for businesses and households to borrow money which can boost spending and growth.  ', 'However, with prices rising so quickly, the Bank has chosen to increase interest rates instead. ', 'The recession in 2020 only lasted for six months, although the 20.4% reduction in the UK economy between April and June that year was the largest on record.', 'The one before that started in 2008 due to the global financial crisis, and went on for five quarters.', 'Â© 2022 BBC.
