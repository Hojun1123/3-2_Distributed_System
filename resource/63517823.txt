Another 5% had less than £50 and a further 4% had between £50 and £100 set aside.', 'If those figures reflect the UK as a whole, then millions of people will have little or nothing as a savings buffer.', "Among them is Kylie, a mother-of-six who faced difficulties that left her failing to pay critical, and priority, bills. She just about managed to pay her rent, to keep a roof over her family's head, but was behind on many other payments.", 'The 31-year-old said some of the more aggressive debt collection left her children frightened, and her finances were in a mess.', 'Her energy provider told her to seek help from a debt charity, but she said she was scared to do so.', '"I felt like I would be judged and looked down on," she said.

', '"We want everyone to start the conversation with family or friends and share the burden of any money worries. By dealing with the problem head on, people can discover just how helpful free debt advice can be and see the importance of talking to their creditors early. They can also begin to find a way forward, no matter how difficult their situation might feel."', 'Kylie, meanwhile, is looking forward to Christmas, but with some trepidation.
