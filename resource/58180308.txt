', 'It said the situation is "not ideal" and that they were "working hard to keep things running smoothly".', '"Please be patient with our teams...they\'\'re doing a brilliant job despite the disruption," it continued. ', 'The company did not say which of its restaurants would be affected. The majority (80%) of KFC outlets are run on a franchise basis. ', 'Replying to the tweet, customers said that there were no cups or lids on drinks. ', 'It is not known how long the disruption will last. ', 'It comes after a <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-43110910" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">previous supply chain problem in 2018</a> when the company had to close 750 restaurants after a delivery contract with DHL led to shortages. ', 'Disruptions across the food and delivery industries are currently being caused by a shortage of HGV drivers, with a combination of fewer drivers from EU member states post Brexit and enforced isolation with drivers being contacted by NHS Test and Trace.', 'The Road Haulage Association believes there is a shortfall of about 100,000 lorry drivers across the country. ', 'Dixons Carphone, which owns Currys PC World and Carphone Warehouse, said on Thursday it would pay new lorry drivers a £1,500 bonus amid the shortage.

They will instead be advised to take PCR test as soon as possible.', '© 2022 BBC.
