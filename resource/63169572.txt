"He was 14 years old."', 'Spacey, who went on to star in films like The Usual Suspects and American Beauty, has kept a fairly low profile since the allegation, which emerged in the wake of the #MeToo movement, which highlighted widespread abuse in the film industry.', 'Last month, Rapp spoke about his accusation in an interview with BuzzFeed News.', 'Spacey responded online, offering his "sincerest apology" to Rapp for any "deeply inappropriate drunken behaviour", saying he did not recall the alleged incident.', 'Rapp filed a civil lawsuit after a 2020 criminal charge of sexual assault was dismissed by a judge.

"This was not horseplay," he added.', 'Spacey\'s own lawyer Jennifer Keller, however, told the jury that such an assault "never happened at all".', 'She noted how down the years, Rapp had "repeated the same false story [but] never repeated it to the police", arguing he had done so for "attention [and] sympathy" because he never became an international star.', 'Ms Keller previously told AFP in an email: "We look forward to his vindication by an impartial jury."', 'The trial is expected to last for two weeks, and, if found guilty, Spacey faces significant damages.', 'In August, a judge ordered Spacey to pay House of Cards producers $31m (£25.5m) for the costs involved in removing him from the series following a string of allegations of sexual misconduct.', 'He appeared at the Old Bailey in London in July to "strenuously" deny allegations of sexual assault by three other men, dating back 17 years to when Spacey was artistic director at The Old Vic theatre.', 'A trial will take place in June 2023, with a pre-hearing expected to take place early next year.', 'World Cup winner Jürgen Klinsmann invites you to subscribe to his daily World Cup newsletter.', '© 2022 BBC.
