', 'EU leaders suspect the leaks were created deliberately, but have stopped short of blaming Russia for them. ', 'Operators noticed leaks in Nord Stream 1 in a stretch of pipe near the Island of Bornholm in the Baltic Sea. There were also leaks in a parallel pipeline called Nord Stream 2, which is not yet in use.  ', 'Seismologists in Denmark said there had been explosions under the sea in the same area as the leaks occurred.', 'President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen says the pipelines were probably sabotaged, but did not say who might be to blame.', 'Russia has denied responsibility.', 'Last year, Russia was supplying EU countries with <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-61497315" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">40% of their natural gas.</a>', "Germany, Europe's largest economy, was the largest importer in 2021, followed by Italy.", 'However, Russia has been steadily reducing supplies.', 'Over the summer, it drastically cut the amount of gas it supplied through Nord Stream 1, from 170m cubic metres a day to 20m cubic metres.', 'It frequently shut the pipeline, citing maintenance work or equipment problems.', 'Overall, Russia has cut it supplies of gas to Europe by 88% over the past year, according to David Fyfe, chief economist with research firm Argus Media. ', 'This has caused the wholesale price of gas to increase by 210% over the same period.', 'In 2021, the UK imported 4% of its needs from Russia. Nowadays, it imports none.
