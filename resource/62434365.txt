', 'Latest data from the Scottish Retail Consortium (SRC) showed footfall in July was 16.5% down on pre-pandemic levels and 0.7% worse than in June.', 'The decline was larger than the UK average of 14.2%.', 'The summer heatwave, rail strikes and the ongoing cost-of-living crisis were all blamed.', 'Ewan MacDonald-Russell, head of policy at the SRC, told <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m0019s7w" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">BBC Radio\'s Good Morning Scotland</a>: "As the year progresses, there is little evidence Scottish consumers are close to returning to pre-pandemic shopping patterns.', '"The reality is big ticket items are down and we know people are trading down from premium goods to value goods and cutting back on spending now.', '"We need action to tackle the high business rates burden and measures to help consumers, particularly less affluent consumers."', 'Mr MacDonald-Russell added that "big and punchy" moves to help consumers were needed, adding there was no room for "half measures"in the UK government\'s autumn budget.', 'Meanwhile, a survey of 100 businesses by the Night Time Industries Association Scotland has found 38% respondents were "unsure" whether they will survive the next 12 months due to soaring costs.

', 'On the calls for more support for the hospitality sector, a Treasury spokesman said the UK government had "stood behind the hospitality sector throughout the pandemic with a £400bn package of economy-wide support that saved millions of jobs and offered a lifeline to thousands of night-time businesses up and down the country."', 'He added: "At the Spring Statement we went further, announcing a £1,000 increase to the Employment Allowance which will cut taxes for thousands of bars, clubs and venues in Scotland."
