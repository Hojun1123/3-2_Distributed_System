Sewer inspections are also just one part of these workers\' job remits."', 'The technology including its software was developed by Environmental Techniques, a surveyor based in Northern Ireland.', 'Scottish Water said the drones would be flown to parts of its 33,000-mile network that traditional surveys could not reach.', 'It added this method could reduce carbon emissions from sewer surveys by as much as 80% by reducing the number of site vans and vehicle deliveries.', 'Iain Jones, the company\'s risk and life cycle planning manager, said: "Drones have been put into sewers elsewhere with limited capabilities and limited success. But the specific adaptation of both drone and the 3D LiDAR modelling is what makes this special.', '"The 4K quality outputs combined with accurate modelling is the innovative thing. That quality is four times better than a HD TV and it\'s certainly a first in Britain.', '"Some of the sewers pre-date the Victorian era and are more than 160 years-old and we need information to enable us to make good decisions about how to rehabilitate them if necessary."', 'World Cup winner Jürgen Klinsmann invites you to subscribe to his daily World Cup newsletter.', '© 2022 BBC.
