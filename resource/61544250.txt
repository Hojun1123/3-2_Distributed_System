However, this increasingly seems unlikely as evidence from a number of companies shows pay at the top rebounding."', 'Mr Haq said wage growth for those on lower incomes would be "critical" to ensure "millions can weather the cost-of-living crisis we are now facing".', 'However, Emily Fielder, head of communications at the Adam Smith Institute, said while "fretting about CEO pay might make for a good headline, getting involved would do little to increase workers\' wages and benefits to shareholders".', 'She claimed research into "unexpected executive deaths and the effect that this had on the companies they represent" had shown that bosses of big firms "have a real impact on a company\'s performance".', '"The UK should be adopting policies which will get the economy growing again, rather than undertaking a PR exercise in the politics of envy," she added.', "The High Pay Centre's most recent chief executive pay analysis said the average FTSE 100 boss was paid £2.69m in 2020.", 'The figure was 86 times the average full-time UK worker but was a 17% drop from £3.25m in 2019.', 'TUC general secretary Frances O\'Grady said: "Pay inequality has gone much too far." ', '"Even for the best-performing executives, pay can be out of all proportion compared to hard-working staff on the frontline," she said.', '"It\'s time we had maximum pay ratios to bring some fairness back."', '© 2022 BBC.
