', 'She said questions about banister heights and sprinkler systems had slowed down projects, so guidelines with definitive answers would be "very helpful" for both developers and planners.', 'Ms Kirby added conservation projects "aren\'t cheap" so a grant scheme could encourage residents to take on registered properties.
