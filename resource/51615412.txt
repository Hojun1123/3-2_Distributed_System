', 'A package holiday should be refunded, in full, within 14 days.', 'This is far less clear-cut. If you cancel, rather than your travel provider, then you have no automatic right to a refund.', 'In this situation, it is worth contacting the airline/holiday provider to see what options you have.', 'EasyJet, for example, has announced that it will extend its "freedom to change" service - which allows passengers to change flights up to two hours before departure for free  - until 31 March, 2022.', 'Some may charge a fee to transfer to another date or destination, but some may allow it without charging a fee. You would have to pay the difference if the alternative flight is more expensive.', 'They may give you a voucher, or they may allow you to cancel and get a refund.', "That may be trickier, according to Rory Boland, travel editor at Which? who said that the property's specific policy will determine whether refunds would be given.", '"If your trip is several weeks or months away, travellers should at this stage do nothing as the situation may change," he said. ', '"Those booking a trip should do so through holiday providers with good, flexible booking policies in case it cannot go ahead."', 'People who have booked a package holiday will be refunded in full, including accommodation, if it is cancelled by the operator.', 'Operators do not have to refund you if you are unexpectedly forced to self-isolate.', 'It is best to study their policies before booking, or see whether they can offer some support if you have already booked and want to cancel.', 'Travel insurers are offering different levels of cover. In part, this depends on how much you pay for a policy.', 'The majority, but not all, will pay out if you test positive for Covid and have to cancel before you travel.', 'Importantly, if the Foreign Office advises against travel to a country - as it is for some in southern Africa at the moment, then all but a handful of travel insurance policies would be invalid if you still decide to go.', 'Rules are inevitably going to be complex, given the risk of Covid varies so much between countries.', 'The government has <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/passenger-covid-19-charter" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">published a charter</a> that "clearly sets out consumer rights and responsibilities when booking travel while Covid-19 measures remain in place".', 'It says it expects travel operators to be "flexible" with customers, given the circumstances, and the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-57097568" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has warned package holiday firms</a> they must stick to refund rules.', '', '</p></div></div><div data-component="links-block" class="ssrcss-5i1hhv-LinksComponentWrapper e3eyuya0"><section class="ssrcss-msolhr-LinksWrapper e3eyuya5"><div class="ssrcss-1lqqmgw-LinksHeadingWrapper e3eyuya4"><h2 class="ssrcss-q4zz1q-StyledHeading e1fj1fc10">More on this story</h2></div><ul role="list" class="ssrcss-10bv2vf-EndOfContentLinksGrid e3eyuya2"><li class="ssrcss-547yr3-PromoItem e3eyuya1"><div class="ssrcss-nxco0v-Promo ett16tt0"><div class="ssrcss-a0724v-PromoSwitchLayoutAtBreakpoints e3z3r3u0"><div class="ssrcss-xekq2n-PromoContent e1f5wbog7"><div spacing="2" class="ssrcss-1f3bvyz-Stack e1y4nx260"><a href="/news/explainers-52544307" class="ssrcss-1j8v9o5-PromoLink e1f5wbog0"><span role="text"><p class="ssrcss-17zglt8-PromoHeadline e1f5wbog4"><span aria-hidden="false">How are travel rules being relaxed?</span>', 'Â© 2022 BBC.
