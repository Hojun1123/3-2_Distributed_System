', 'Earlier, a company spokesman told the Indian Express newspaper: "While we are waiting for more information, prima facie, the bridge collapsed as too many people in the mid-section... were trying to sway it from one way to the other."

I survived and have been looking for her everywhere, I went to the government hospital also, but my sister is nowhere to be found," he said, sobbing.', 'A video shot before the collapse showed the overcrowded bridge swaying while people gripped the netting on its sides.', "After the incident, dozens were seen clinging onto the wreckage as emergency teams attempted to rescue them. Some survivors clambered up the bridge's broken netting, and others managed to swim to the river banks. ", 'Early on Monday morning, rescuers made an opening in a small dam on the river, about 500 metres downstream, to reduce the water flow. ', 'The bridge above the dam was packed with people, waiting to hear news of their loved ones.', 'Gujarat is the home state of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has announced compensation for the families of victims. He said he was "deeply saddened by the tragedy" and its cause would be investigated.', 'Leader of the opposition Congress party Mallikarjun Kharge demanded a judicial inquiry to find out how the bridge collapsed within just "five-six days" of being reopened, and who allowed so many people on it.
