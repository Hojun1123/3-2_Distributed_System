Because I wasn\'t involved so much when I was growing up, I hadn\'t learnt quite enough to know exactly what I was doing, so I was sort of thrown in. And I had to pick up all the skills and do it myself." ', 'Her typical day begins with milking at a neighbouring farm before heading back to her 180-acre home, Segrwyd Isaf, and tending to 70 cows and 30 sheep.', 'In the middle of all this, she makes time for social media and connecting with people online has been essential for Ffion as the impact of having to work alone for hours on end took its toll.', '"It was a big jump and it is a lonely job and it was a struggle to be constantly on my own," she said. ', '"I use social media a lot. I share my farming journey on there by posting pictures and sharing everyday life.', '"I\'ve grown a big following, so a lot of people are following my journey and learning stuff as well with me along the way. ', '"That helps and I\'ve made friends from that. And I get to talk to people on there and learn stuff from them. I follow quite a few big farmers as well, so we get to talk through that, and it takes away that loneliness."', 'Ffion has 5,000 followers on Instagram and also uses Facebook and Twitter to connect with people.

', '"They reached out to me... and it made me feel, then, that I wasn\'t alone, and that it was OK to talk."', 'Loneliness is very prevalent in the farming community, she said, adding: "Because most farmers are alone doing this job for 24 hours, seven days a week.', '"There is a lot of cut off and if you\'re not within social media... then I suppose you would feel even more isolated than you are normally."', "At just 22, Ffion already has a few years' experience of running a family farm under her belt and, although it has been a struggle at times, she thinks young people should embrace careers in agriculture, but ensuring they take steps to look after their mental health.", '"Make time for yourself," she said. ', '"Don\'t just focus yourself on the job. Do the job because it\'s an amazing industry and way of life, but make sure you make time for yourself on the side and talk to people."', 'World Cup winner Jürgen Klinsmann invites you to subscribe to his daily World Cup newsletter.', '© 2022 BBC.
