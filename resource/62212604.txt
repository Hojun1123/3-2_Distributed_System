['<b class="ssrcss-hmf8ql-BoldText e5tfeyi3">People on social media have been comparing the high temperatures in much of the UK with the heatwave of 1976, suggesting that the severity of the current hot weather is being exaggerated. </b>', 'So, what does the evidence show?

That has been beaten by the current temperatures, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-62217282" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">with 40.3C recorded</a> so far.', 'The heatwave of 1976 started in June and lasted for two months. There was a lack of rainfall and a significant drought, with the government enforcing water rationing. ', 'The heatwave was rare for that decade.

In the 2010s, it was more than 20C.', 'The UK has been slowly getting warmer since the 19th Century, and this has sped up.

', 'But if you look at the heat maps (produced by NASA) for June 2022, it shows many more countries affected.', '"We can easily see how much warmer the global climate has become - with very few areas actually colder than normal," says BBC Weather presenter, Matt Taylor.', 'Suggestions that there is nothing unusual about this heatwave appear to have found a willing audience among climate change sceptics.', 'Hundreds of people have shared their experiences of the 1976 heatwave on social media, with some making the misleading suggestion that the current heatwave is "no different".', 'Others have accused the Met Office and the media of spreading "alarmism" and "hysteria". Some have suggested people need to "toughen up", describing those complaining about the heat as "snowflakes".', 'But even in the 1976 heatwave - which saw lower temperatures - excess deaths in parts of the country <a href="https://jech.bmj.com/content/jech/56/5/367.full.pdf" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">were up 30%</a>.
