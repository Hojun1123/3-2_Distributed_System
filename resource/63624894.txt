", 'Despite strong warnings from watchdogs about the risk of crypto investments, around 6.7 million people in the UK own or have bought crypto assets - close to one-tenth of the population.', 'In September, financial watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/news/warnings/ftx" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">warned</a> that FTX may be providing financial services or products in the UK without its authorisation.

Investors should expect pennies on the dollar," said crypto blogger and author David Gerard.', 'Mr Gerard argued that in many of these failures there are "real liabilities but imaginary assets" and that a huge proportion of the assets are in exchanges\' own tokens - such as FTX\'s FTT token -  to which "they\'ve assigned a spurious value in the billions".', 'The FCA says people worried about their finances should go to a government-backed organisation, <a href="https://www.moneyhelper.org.uk/en" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Moneyhelper</a>.
