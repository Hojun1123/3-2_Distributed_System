', 'In an email to a customer which was seen by trade magazine The Grocer, Farmdrop advised customers to contact their card suppliers for refunds. ', '"If you have paid for an order with us, we would recommend getting in touch with your bank or card supplier to initiate a chargeback," the email said.', 'Nicola Simons, founder of fruit preserves and chilli jam producer Single Variety Co, said that Farmdrop still owed her £2,200 in unpaid invoices dating back to August.

', '"While they had a huge surge in returning customers, the food system itself is really vulnerable," she explained.  ', 'The rising cost of living, spiking energy prices and worker shortages have all combined to increase the pressures on the food industry throughout the pandemic. ', 'Many UK sectors, from petrol stations to supermarkets, have experienced problems with deliveries due to the shortages of lorry drivers.', 'Food firms have struggled to recruit workers, partly due to the pandemic, but this is also compounded by Brexit, according to the<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-59477093" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0"> Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.</a>', 'Price rises in animal feed coming from abroad have also meant that it is "not necessarily the suppliers, but <i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">their </i>suppliers" that potentially had issues along the supply chain, said Dr McLoughlin.', '"Cost and speed was great for our supply chain but now the free flow of those materials has changed and transitioning to a local economy means shifting how those systems work," she said.
