', 'He also said that difficulties shipping out food supplies from Ukraine could hit world supplies of wheat and cooking oil.', 'World wheat prices <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-61461093" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">have risen 25% over the past six weeks</a>.', '"There\'s a lot of uncertainty around this situation," Mr Bailey said.', '"And that is a major, major worry and it\'s not just I have to tell you a major worry for this country. There\'s a major worry for the developing world as well. And so if I had to sort of, sorry for being apocalyptic for a moment, but that is a major concern."', 'Mr Bailey warned that price rises in food and energy would have a much bigger effect than any rise in interest rates.', 'With the government coming under intense pressure over the cost of living crisis, there have been reports that <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2022/05/14/cabinet-ministers-launch-unprecedented-attack-bank-england-inflation/" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">some Cabinet ministers are unhappy with the Bank\'s performance</a> and have questioned whether it should keep its independence.', 'Inflation hit 7% in March, and figures due out later this week are expected to show the rate climbed higher in April.

I don\'t think we could foresee a war in Ukraine."', 'He pointed to a further wave of Covid, particularly in China, as another factor putting pressure on prices.', 'On the question of the Bank\'s independence, Mr Bailey said it was something he was "always" concerned about ensuring.', '"This is the biggest test of the monetary policy framework that we have had in 25 years, no question about that," he said.', '"What I would say to these people is that this is when both the independence of the Bank and the target framework and the nominal anchor matter more than ever, frankly.
