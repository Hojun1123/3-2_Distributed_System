', '"It\'s been a rollercoaster ride the last year or so since reopening after Covid with all the protocols. ', '"Through the pandemic, a lot of the European workers went back to their home countries and with Brexit it meant they\'re not allowed to return so that\'s created a big skills shortage amongst positions like chefs, food and beverage staff."', 'The Vale hotel and resort, which employs 400 people, needs to fill another 30 vacancies and train some of its newest recruits so it has had to limit capacity in some areas and with certain restaurant offerings.
