"They\'ve literally walked in… but the sooner we start on the monitoring, the quicker we can give them the medication to minimise the withdrawals."', 'The Chapman-Barker Unit is one of only seven such centres in the UK.', 'For many patients who come here from across the north of England and even further afield, it is their best hope of conquering their addiction.', 'Patients generally spend two weeks here - sometimes longer - being treated by a team of clinicians who have a range of specialisms.', 'They will not only supervise the withdrawal from alcohol but also offer targeted psycho-social therapies to try to work out what drives their addiction.', 'Having been breathalysed, the new arrival is given a tour of the unit and shown to his room.

', 'New arrivals are often given an intravenous drip of thiamine and other vitamins.', 'They are also given medication to calm the brain down, because the sudden removal of alcohol can overstimulate the brain and cause seizures.', '"The highest risk of seizures is in the first two days," says Dr Kaar.', '"In the next three to four days there\'s a high risk of developing something called Delirium Tremens where people can get very confused, very agitated, hallucinate."', 'Patients who experience this need constant one-to-one monitoring.', 'By the end of the first week though the worst of the withdrawal symptoms are generally over.', 'At that point the team concentrates more on psychological therapies and treatment.
