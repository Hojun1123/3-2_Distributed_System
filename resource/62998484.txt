The court, sitting in Barnet, was warned by coroner Andrew Walker the footage was "most distressing... it is almost impossible to watch".', 'Mr Walker told the inquest there had been a discussion about whether to edit the videos before they were played.', 'He added: "But Molly had no such choice, so we would in effect be editing the footage for adult viewing when it was available in an unedited form for a child."', 'On Thursday, Pinterest\'s head of community operations, Judson Hoffman, apologised after admitting the platform was "not safe" when the 14-year-old used it.', 'Mr Hoffman said he "deeply regrets" posts viewed by Molly on the image-sharing site before her death, saying it was material he would "not show to my children".', 'The inquest, due to last up to two weeks, continues.', '<i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">If you\'ve been affected by </i><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/2NfvF9kvC5N1nFllK9XzBWS/information-and-support-self-harm" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">self-harm</a> or <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/4WLs5NlwrySXJR2n8Snszdg/emotional-distress-information-and-support" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">emotional distress</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">, help and support is available via </i><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/actionline" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">the BBC Action Line</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">.</i>', 'Follow BBC London on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BBCLondon" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/BBCLondonNews" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Twitter </a>and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bbclondon/?hl=en" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Instagram</a>.
