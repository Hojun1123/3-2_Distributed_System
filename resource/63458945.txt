', 'Progress on these pledges could provide an indication of how likely nations are to succeed in achieving what has just been signed off in Sharm el-Sheikh.', 'So far, climate experts have told the BBC that progress in 2022 has been slow - with governments around the world distracted by global energy and financial crises. ', 'Last week the UN warned the world is <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-63407459" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">heading towards catastrophe</a>. But there are rays of hope - including fresh US legislation and a change of government in Brazil that could reverse the Amazon rainforest\'s destruction.', 'As leaders depart from COP27 in Egypt, we look at seven key players to ask who is leading the way and who is dragging their feet.', 'The US made a huge leap forward this year when it passed sweeping new laws to confront climate change.', 'Measures within the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-62457386" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Inflation Reduction Act</a> could reduce US greenhouse gas emissions - those gases that warm the atmosphere - by 40% by 2030.', '"This is the biggest investment in climate solutions in US history. It\'s a huge sign of progress," Dan Lashof, US director at the World Resources Institute, told BBC News.', 'The bill aims to make green energy the default in major sectors like electricity, transport and industry. The most obvious result for consumers is a tax credit of around $7,500 (£6,500) for those who buy an electric car.', 'But it is not all good news. In response to the energy crisis, President Joe Biden released 15m barrels of oil from reserves on to the market and approved new leases for oil and gas drilling. ', 'And after a senior US politician controversially visited Taiwan, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-62438262" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">China ended its co-operation with the US on climate</a>, this has potentially slowed progress on climate action.

Dithering from the Prime Minister is worse in a year when we are the presidents of COP," explains Ms Gilbert. ', 'And the UK has not increased its ambition to tackle its role in climate change, according to analysis by Climate Action Tracker of plans submitted to the UN. (These are called Nationally Determined Contributions - part of the landmark Paris Agreement in which countries promised to regularly increase ambition to tackle climate change).', 'The global energy crisis also led the UK to back-track on commitments to end new oil and gas extraction in the North Sea and close down coal-powered stations.', 'These changes may not fundamentally alter the UK\'s energy balance - but they "send the wrong signal", explains Robert Falkner, professor of International Relations at the London School of Economics.', "The European Union is historically progressive on tackling climate change, but Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the impact on energy supplies to Europe have undermined that.", '"Leaders extended the lifeline of coal-fired power plants and and we estimate that European emissions actually increased by about 2% in the first six months of this year," says Prof Robert Falkner.', 'Climate Action Tracker now rates EU\'s climate targets, policies, and finance as "insufficient", and the EU has not updated the UN with new NDC plans.', 'But Prof Falkner considers the return to investing in fossil fuels a "temporary setback" and suggests the EU could take this opportunity to make itself energy secure by investing in renewables.', "A new plan, the REPowerEU plan, aims to increase the EU's share of renewable energy in 2030 from 40% to 45%. ", 'India is one of the few countries to have published updated climate targets in 2022. ', '"It is almost impossible to talk about India without talking about progress," says Kamya Choudhary at London School of Economics.', 'It promises to reduce emissions intensity by 45% by 2030 - meaning it plans to reduce emissions per dollar. It also wants 50% of installed energy to be renewable.', 'But India\'s plan to <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-61330302" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">reopen 100 coal mines</a> (coal is the most polluting fossil fuel) could be a barrier to those ambitions.', 'Professor Navroz Dubash at Centre for Public Policy and UN climate advisor told the BBC that tariffs on coal are helping to pay for key infrastructure, and the loss of that income needs to be plugged.', 'However, as in other countries, Kamya Choudhary suggests this is a short-term measure to cope with the energy crisis.', "Climate Action Tracker says India's pledges are not very ambitious - they could be achieved with limited government action.", 'Brazil holds one of the keys to fighting climate change - its massive Amazon rainforest, the lungs of the planet, soaks up huge amounts of carbon.

"Brazil is ready to retake its leadership in the fight against the climate crisis," Lula said on Sunday.', 'In 2021 alone <a href="https://www.gov.br/inpe/pt-br" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">deforestation increased by 48%</a>.

In response, it invested in oil and gas - with predictions that its use of oil will increase by 70% by 2030.

Unlike countries in the developed world, it is not responsible for historical greenhouse gas emissions that scientists say have caused climate change so far. ', 'But it is now a "terrific polluter" because of its very rapid economic growth, explains Neil Hurst, senior policy fellow for energy and mitigation at the Grantham Institute. It burns half of the coal in the world, and is reluctant to cut back because of energy shortages. ', 'However, China is also by far the biggest investors in renewable energy. A quarter of newly-registered cars in China are electric. "They\'re making big efforts and setting demanding targets, including peaking its carbon emissions by 2030," explains Mr Hurst.', 'And it has big ambitions to address carbon emissions with tree planting. In May, President Xi Jinping pledged to plant 70 billion trees by 2030.', '<i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">Additional reporting by Data Journalism team.</i>', '<i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">Top image from Getty Images.
