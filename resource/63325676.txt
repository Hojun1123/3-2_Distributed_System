Because to point at any one part of the NHS in Wales wouldn't give you the full answer.", "Let's start with ambulances. A growing number of calls to the service - consistently 100-plus per day - are the most urgent and the goal is to get to them within eight minutes. That happens in half the cases.", "Why? Many are already at hospital, waiting to handover a patient. That's meant to happen within 15 minutes. In reality, just a fraction (17.77%) do so. ", 'The service refers to this as "lost hours" - last month more than 11,000 patients were taken to A&amp;E in Wales, but more than 24,500 hours were "lost" waiting for that transfer.', 'Why? Because hospitals are full.', "The stats show on average there's more than 2,800 people turning up every day to a Welsh A&amp;E. We know too, that over half a million are waiting for planned procedures.", "And you can't look at hospitals without also looking at the lack of social care on the other side - with typically a thousand patients in hospital well enough to be discharged but without the care they need to safely discharge them.", "Add in staff shortages, burnout and intensifying health issues for patients waiting ever longer, and you get a glimpse into why Georgia and Tobias's experience will resonate for many others too.", 'Ms Morgan said: "I\'ve got to say I\'m sorry - I think that\'s an unacceptable situation and that call should have clearly been prioritised.', '"People need to understand the incredible pressure the ambulance service is under but there are times when certain cases need to be prioritised."', 'The Welsh Ambulance Service said it was very sorry about the distressing experience Georgia went through, adding it was under extreme pressure.
