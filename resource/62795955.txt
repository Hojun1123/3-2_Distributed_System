", "But as the app grows in popularity, do we need to be more careful what we post when we're on shift?", "Or is zooming in on your friend's work computer just innocent fun?", 'The app was released in 2020, but started to get much more popular in mid-2022. Some reports say BeReal has had more than <a href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/bereal-statistics/#:~:text=Source%3A%20Apptopia-,BeReal%20downloads,in%20the%20past%2012%20months." class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">27 million downloads worldwide</a>.

It gives you just two minutes to stop and take a picture of your surroundings.", 'The idea is that it takes you off-guard, forcing you to be more "real" than you might be when curating, for example, an Instagram story.

Screenshots could be taken, or phones passed around among friends. ', '"Especially if people are zooming in and reading emails, you may well be in breach of contract," she says.', '"It could lead to disciplinaries, and so you could find yourself in a lot of trouble with your employer."', 'You might be thinking this advice is dramatic, and be tempted to snap that photo next time your BeReal alert goes off.', "But Emma's key advice is that the post isn't worth the hassle it might cause. ", "Even if it's meant to be an innocent picture, shared among friends, if it ends up further than that you could be in trouble.
