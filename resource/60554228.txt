', 'But spending it is important, she argues, for geopolitical and business reasons, since Asia currently totally dominates the semiconductor industry.', '"There needs to be a little more balance," she argues.', 'The trouble is that Europe is behind on multiple fronts, not just the manufacturing of chips. ', 'There are also relatively few firms within the EU that design new chips for use in technology products. That is in stark contrast to the US, which already has a sizeable semiconductor design industry. US firms lead the way in determining which chips actually get made.', 'There is little sense in spending huge sums of money on manufacturing capabilities in a region as expensive for that sort of thing as Europe, without having more control over chip design, explains Alicia Garcia-Herrero, chief economist for Asia-Pacific at Natixis, an investment bank.', '"I\'m not sure this is the right strategy, to be frank," she says, referring to the Chips Act, "We should spend more money on design."', 'This sentiment is backed up by a report from German think tank, Stiftung Neue Verantwortung (SNV), which <a href="https://www.stiftung-nv.de/de/publikation/lack-semiconductor-manufacturing-europe" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">published a policy brief last year</a> on the lack of semiconductor manufacturing in Europe. The report suggests that with few Europe-designed chips, any new chip factories, or "fabs", in the region would need to seek orders from elsewhere, such as the US.', '"Why would [US firms without semiconductor-manufacturing capabilities] choose to manufacture their chips not in South Korea, Taiwan or the United States but in Europe?" the brief asked.', 'There are other problems, too. Chip makers have been offering smaller and smaller "node sizes", currently measured in nanometres (nm), to indicate the ever greater technical achievements of their manufacturing processes.', 'Also, semiconductors are manufactured on large discs called wafers, which are then split into thousands of smaller pieces - the individual chips themselves. ', 'Over time, the size of these wafers has increased to allow more chips to be made at once. Cutting-edge chips are generally made on 300mm wafers today, says Koray Köse, an analyst at Gartner. ', 'While Europe does have some production capacity for 300mm wafers, it is very far behind the US and Asia. ', 'That leads to the question - what sort of chips Europe should be aiming to produce and why - as Europe is currently behind on everything and must choose its battles.', '"There is no Apple, or Foxconn, manufacturing location in Spain that would consume gazillions of 300mm wafer products," says Mr Köse.', 'European industry, in general, does not require many of the cutting edge, sub-10nm chips, says Julia Hess at SNV, who adds, "The demand in Europe is basically focused on industrial and automotive demands and these kind of chips do not rely on cutting edge fabrication."', 'In theory, Europe could try to improve its capacity for producing the older, larger chips. ', "But this strategy wouldn't be easy to do either, because of equipment constraints and the fact that many countries around the world - including those with much lower costs - are trying to do this right now.", "It is also worth noting that current headaches with chip production, although still ongoing, are beginning to clear up. Analysis from Gartner suggests that there will actually be a global surplus of chips again in around two years' time.", "It's not that Europe can't improve its position in the semiconductor industry, but these analysts tend to agree that reacting to the recent shortage by attempting to boost manufacturing alone would not be a straightforward, or wise, decision. ", 'And as Jan-Peter Kleinhans, also of SNV, says, trying to shore-up production of chips in Europe to shield the car industry from future supply shocks will likely not be effective, since the industry will still, inevitably, rely on global supply chains.', '"A modern car needs hundreds of different chips sourced from countless fabs worldwide," he says. "How does it increase your resilience against supply disruptions if you source [a percentage] of those chips domestically?', 'Instead, he suggests, car makers and other industries in Europe should make their supply chains more resilient by making them more transparent - and stockpiling chips in advance of the next crisis.', '© 2022 BBC.
