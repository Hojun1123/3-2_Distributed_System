', 'Sir David Green QC describes checks the government required banks to do on bounce back loan applicants as "hopelessly inadequate".', 'A total of 1.5 million loans worth £47bn were handed out. One of several measures designed to help businesses survive the pandemic, the loans were supposed to be paid back within 10 years. But in the rush to save the economy, checks on borrowers were limited.', 'Under the scheme any small company could apply for a loan of up to £50,000 depending on its turnover. Applicants were allowed to "self-certify" the figures.', '"You wouldn\'t send an army into battle without assessing the risks. And just the same in this situation, the risks, which were obvious, should have been assessed and addressed," said Sir David, who is now chairman of the Fraud Advisory Panel.', 'He believes bounce back loan money must be recovered wherever possible.', 'The government has said it will "not tolerate" people defrauding taxpayers.

I was advised to liquidate the company, having been willing to repay the loan up to that point."', 'He has confirmed that he took out a total of five bounce back loans, including the one for Beautiful Digital Events. As for the four others, he said "one has already been paid back in full and a payment has not been missed on the others".', 'Scrolling through the website of the Insolvency Service, we found scores of company directors who took out loans with, it seems, little or no prospect of being able to repay them.

The maximum ban lasts 15 years. ", 'But the service has no record of how much money has been recovered because each case is handled separately by a private insolvency practitioner.', 'The government has also asked the National Investigation Service (Natis) - a law enforcement organisation which usually investigates local authority corruption - to look into the scheme. ', 'The latest figures show Natis, which has a £6m budget, made 49 arrests and recovered just £4.1m. It has identified 673 suspects of whom 559 used the bounce back loan scheme.', 'It\'s now thought <a href="https://www.nao.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/The-Bounce-Back-Loan-Scheme-an-update.pdf" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">£17bn could be lost</a> to fraud, mistakes and companies going under.
