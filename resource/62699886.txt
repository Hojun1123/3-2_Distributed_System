", 'Floods are not uncommon in Pakistan, but people here said these rains were different - more than anything that\'s ever been seen. One local official called them "floods of biblical proportions". ', "Near the city of Larkana, thousands of mud homes have sunk under water. For miles all that's visible is treetops. Where the water level is slightly lower, thatched roofs creep out from underneath the water.", 'In one village, the people are desperate for food. In another, many children have developed waterborne diseases.', 'When a mobile truck pulled over, scores of people immediately ran towards it. Children carrying other children made their way to the long queue. ', 'One 12-year-old girl said she and her baby sister had not eaten for a day.

The country has appealed for more international aid. ', "In Sindh, it's not that local authorities are not trying, but they admit that they are out of their depth. ", 'The provincial government says this is a "climate change catastrophe" and that the people of Pakistan, especially in the poorer communities, have been the worst affected.', 'The solutions will not be quick - acres of land are waterlogged and the water is not receding fast enough for any rebuilding to take place here. ', "There's not much to do for the people but to wait - wait for the rains to stop, wait for the water to go down, wait for more resources to be allocated to these kinds of communities.
