It is a deeply cynical attempt to provide cover for reckless plans to expand the very industry that is fuelling both the climate and the cost-of-living crises."', 'The three tests which form the climate compatibility checkpoint will cover:', 'The proposed tests which have been abolished focused on:', 'Speaking ahead of the announcement, Mike Theolen from Offshore Energies UK (OEUK) said: "We need new licences now because the UK continental shelf is what we call a mature basin where many existing fields are in gentle decline. ', '"That means we rely on finding new oil and gas resources simply to maintain production at current levels. We need new exploration and production licences so that we can find those reserves. ', '"Delays in issuing licences could lead to reduced gas and oil production - and that would damage our energy security."', 'Â© 2022 BBC.
