', 'The investment would cut energy bills by up to a quarter each year and prevent 20 tons of carbon dioxide from being released, it said.', 'The panels would be installed later this year if planning permission was granted, according to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/lnp/ldrs" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">the Local Democracy Reporting Service</a>.', 'A North Kesteven District Council spokesperson said: "Like households, energy price increases are affecting councils as well."', "Annual electricity consumption for the council's offices in 2019 was nearly 330,000 kWh per annum, meaning that at a cost of 13.29p per kWh, the authority's energy bill was £44,000, the spokesperson said.", '"The current price of electricity is 28p per kWh, a little more than double.
