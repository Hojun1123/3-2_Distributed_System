The quantity and how it was stored increased the risk of infections being passed on to people and staff.', '"Additionally, this resulted in some people not having enough clean clothes and having to wear other people\'s. Also, staff told us they weren\'t always able to change bedding as often due to the shortage of clean sheets, so people were living with dirty bed sheets which is totally unacceptable."', 'Inspectors found appropriate checks were not carried out on 19 out of 28 agency workers at the home, there were inaccuracies and omissions with the administration and recording of medicines, and safeguarding systems were not "robust enough" to ensure people were protected from the risk of abuse.', 'It did find residents were supported with communication needs, end-of-life care plans were in place and visitors were supported to see their relatives in the home, with some telling inspectors staff had "caring attitudes".', 'A new home manager, activities coordinator and activities assistant have been appointed by Four Seasons at East Riding since the inspection.', '<i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">Follow BBC North East &amp; Cumbria on </i><a href="https://twitter.com/BBCNEandCumbria" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Twitter</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">, </i><a href="https://www.facebook.com/bbcneandcumbria" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Facebook</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2"> and </i><a href="https://www.instagram.com/bbcneandcumbria/" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Instagram</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">.
