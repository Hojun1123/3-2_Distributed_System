Many firms have been unable to fully pass on the rise in wholesale gas prices to customers.

But it had since made profits in its oil and gas exploration operations, which is why it is re-introducing payouts.', '"Businesses are there to make a profit, and dividends are one way of sharing that with shareholders," he said.', 'But Centrica chief executive Chris O\'Shea defended the decision and insisted a lot of the firm\'s profits were "going back into society".', '"I know it\'s difficult to see the word profits, or dividends, or similar words when people are having a tough time. I\'m very conscious of this," he said.', '"Bear in mind, over the next couple of years we are expecting to pay a windfall tax of probably well over £600m on our UK gas business off the back of the profits that we\'re seeing, so a lot of this is going back into society."', 'Energy giant Shell also reported strong results on Thursday, with second quarter profits of $11.5bn (£9bn).', 'The company also announced another $6bn share buyback programme for the current quarter, on top of the $8.5bn of shares it bought back in the first half of 2022. But it did not raise its dividend of 25 cents per share.', 'Frances O\'Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said soaring profits from Centrica and Shell were "an insult" to people struggling to pay their energy bills.', '"Energy bills are rising 23 times faster than wages. We need to hold down profits and boost wages," she said. "Working people are facing the longest and harshest wage squeeze in modern history."', 'Environmental campaign group Friends of the Earth said the profits reported by both Centrica and Shell would be "greeted with disbelief" by those facing "rocketing energy prices".
