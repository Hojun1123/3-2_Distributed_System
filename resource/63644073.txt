', '"The trust don\'t understand what it\'s like to have a rural hospital - travel is not acceptable," Dermot Browne told BBC News NI.', '"We fought hard to get this hospital here in the first place."', 'Mr Browne added that "the direction of travel has been concerning for people here".', '"If there is an issue with staff that needs to be resolved with services reinstated as soon as possible."', 'Despite saying the move was temporary, the trust did not say when it expected emergency general surgery would resume.', 'The emergency department and other services including obstetrics will continue to operate as normal.', 'Other - mostly lower grade - surgeons will remain on site at the County Fermanagh hospital.', "The trust said this was necessary to protect the public's safety after it had problems recruiting surgical staff.", 'Protesters gathered outside the town hall in objection to the announcement.', 'Representatives from the trust held a meeting with local community and council representatives in Enniskillen Town Hall on Thursday evening.', 'At it, Mr Guckian said that regardless of what had been reported in the media, he was "proud of the engagement between the trust and the council".', 'He said the trust was dealing with a very difficult situation in regard to emergency surgery and was "working our way through this".', 'He paid tribute to all surgeons at SWAH for maintaining services over the years in challenging circumstances. ', "However, Reggie Ferguson, chairman from Save Our Acute Services (SOAS), told the meeting it was his organisation's belief that the trust had been deliberately running down services in preparation for the announcement.", '"This has been on the cards for a long time," he said.', '"Your communication is terrible, everything seems to be behind the scenes."', 'Referring to the region\'s poor infrastructure in the context of proposals to transport some patients to other hospitals, Mr Ferguson added: "The road to Altnagelvin would make you sick if you weren\'t sick already."

', 'The Western Trust argues that change is necessary as the service is no longer safe. ', 'Whatever the argument, local people say it feels like this is being thrust on them as a last resort.  ', 'They tell me what should have taken place was much needed dialogue, explanation and local people being properly informed about how the proposed changes will affect them.', 'Instead, they say, a vacuum was created which encouraged rumour and misinformation that SWAH was set to remove all its emergency services.
