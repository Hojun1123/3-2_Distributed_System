', "That's compared to the general population where one in four had reported loneliness some or all of the time.", 'One in three people aged 16-24 also said they experience loneliness.', 'A spokesperson for the foundation says racism and social inequality could contribute to these higher rates.', 'It surveyed 6,000 people across the UK.', "Rhyanna says she realised she was lonely after giving birth to her son when she was 17.
