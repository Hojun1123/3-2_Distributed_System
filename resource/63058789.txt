', 'Masks will be made available in dispensers at all main hospital entrances, the trust said.', 'The policy is also being applied to Aldeburgh Hospital, Felixstowe Hospital, Bluebird Lodge in Ipswich, Clacton Hospital and Fryatt Hospital in Harwich.', "It covers all general adult wards, including maternity and children's wards. ", 'Giles Thorpe, the trust\'s chief nurse and director of infection prevention and control, said: "We appreciate face masks are no longer required in many areas of our day-to-day lives, but our hospitals are not the same as a supermarket or a restaurant. ', '"Many of our patients are already extremely unwell and could be at higher risk of serious illness if they pick up Covid-19.', '"Sadly we have seen an increase in the number of patients who have Covid-19, so we are having to enhance infection prevention and control measures in our wards and departments."', '<i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">Find BBC News: East of England on </i><a href="https://www.facebook.com/bbcnewseast/" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Facebook</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">, </i><a href="https://www.instagram.com/bbceastofengland/" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Instagram</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2"> and </i><a href="https://twitter.com/bbclookeast" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Twitter</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">.
