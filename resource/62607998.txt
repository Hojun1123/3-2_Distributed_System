', 'Cineworld has been contacted for comment.', 'The firm had hoped blockbusters such as the latest Bond film, Top Gun: Maverick and Thor: Love And Thunder would draw audiences back after Covid restrictions.', 'But it said earlier this week: "Despite a gradual recovery of demand since reopening in April 2021, recent admission levels have been below expectations.', '"These lower levels of admissions are due to a limited film slate that is anticipated to continue until November 2022 and are expected to negatively impact trading and the group\'s liquidity position in the near term."', 'Cineworld has 9,189 screens across more than 750 sites.', 'It operates in 10 countries, including the UK, the US, Poland and Israel, and employs more than 28,000 people.
