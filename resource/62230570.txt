['<b class="ssrcss-hmf8ql-BoldText e5tfeyi3">A Scottish surgeon has swapped Raigmore Hospital in Inverness for a Ukrainian field hospital just 19 miles from the Russian border. </b>', "Prof Angus Watson has spent the last six weeks putting together the facility after Vladimir Putin's forces destroyed the local hospital. ", 'Shells took out the operating rooms and left a giant hole in the wall of a maternity unit. ', 'Now the consultant general and colorectal surgeon is working at a tented temporary surgical ward, serving a community learning to live with war. ', "The exact location of the facility can't be revealed for security reasons, but it is in an area previously occupied by Russian forces.", 'Prof Watson is there with the front line medical aid charity UK-Med which responds to humanitarian disasters and conflicts.', 'Speaking to <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000fdlr" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">BBC Radio Scotland\'s Drivetime programme</a>, he described shock at what he found in Eastern Europe.', 'He said: "If you imagine a wee Scottish town with a couple of roads, maybe 3,000 people, the Russians have been in and destroyed the hospital, destroyed the shops and residencies. ', '"There are burnt-out buildings, particularly around where the railway station is. If you do a 360 degree look-around, almost every building has been either burnt or destroyed.', '"There is a huge pile of windows - they had to replace every window in the hospital."', 'UK-Med were asked by the Ukrainian ministry of health to set up a field hospital.', 'Three Russian tanks had fired shells into the local hospital.

Although the Russians have been and gone, they have left their scars - both physical and mental.', '"There\'s actually drone footage of the attack so you can see the three Russian tanks and there is no reason on earth to attack a hospital. With modern-day maps that hospital would have been clearly marked."', 'Arriving at the hospital, the professor was able to survey the damage. He said the top three floors were immediately taken out of action.', 'And he witnessed scenes of devastation that will stay with him forever.', '"There was a shell that went through the wall of the operating theatre, went through the wall and hit a metal cabinet. You can see where the shell has gone in, and gone out," he said.', '"I was speaking to the chief of surgery, a local surgeon who had worked in that hospital for 43 years, and he was in his office when the shell dropped and if the cabinet hadn\'t been there the shell would have gone into his office.', '"Just below that there was a baby unit - there\'s a picture of a baby on the wall showing it\'s the maternity unit and there is a great big hole next to it. I thought this was absolutely terrible."', 'The pop-up hospital was built in 12 days and includes an operating theatre, recovery area, 20-bed ward and A&amp;E.
