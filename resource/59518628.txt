', 'There are also serious shortages of medicines, equipment and health workers to treat those injured.', 'Existing medical facilities are not equipped to handle major emergencies, and one health clinic employee told the BBC that hundreds of injured people had gone to a medical facility which had only five beds.', 'Communications have also been disrupted as mobile towers and power lines were destroyed.', 'The World Food Programme (WFP) spokesperson for Afghanistan, Shelley Thakral, said that getting aid to the most affected regions was a logistical challenge.  ', '"We are getting [in] supplies where we can, but there are some areas where assistance has not reached because of its remoteness," Ms Thakral told us.
