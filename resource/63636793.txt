I thought it was bad through the pandemic but we could cope through the pandemic," she said.', '"Now with the cost of living everything is going up like milk, basic essentials that we need for Arwen. You\'re spending more money on the same stuff, it\'s ridiculous.', '"It is hard but we manage to do it because we\'ve got a baby, so we have to do it," Christina said.', "She hasn't put the heating on at home yet, relying instead on dressing gowns, blankets and visits to the hub.", '"It gives us a warm space to go with Arwen, it means we can turn everything off and we do save electricity that way. I\'m dreading the winter because I know it\'s going to get cold."', 'Christina helps out at the hub and at the charity\'s shop, and said people walk away "feeling a lot better" because they have had someone to talk to.', '"It\'s warm and welcoming, even if you just want a coffee."', "Some weeks that means they use the hub's food bank.", '"At least we know that the baby can eat, by us accessing a food bank it means we can eat as well."', 'Patricia Tuckwell, 69, comes to the lunch club every Monday, and the meal, company and the warmth mean a lot to her, as she lives alone and is making big cuts to cope financially.', 'She said: "You\'ve got to be strict with yourself.', '"Water I\'m not using so much, showers are only once a week and the washing machine only goes on once a week.', '"We help each other out, it\'s lovely."', 'Like Christina and Patricia, Jonathan Burchell helps out at the hub too.', 'He volunteers "to give something back" in return for the help he\'s had.', 'Unable to work because of arthritis of the spine and mental health issues, Jonathan struggled to budget when his heating and electricity bills went up.', 'He said: "The food came in very handy, and it was somewhere to come for company.', '"I\'m in a much better place than I was, they helped me out. I get paid monthly so I budget monthly.', '"All my bills go out straight away the same day my money comes in and then I do my shopping and what\'s left over, if there\'s anything left over, is left in the bank."', 'Sarah transformed the hut from being a warehouse for deliveries to a community centre and food bank after noticing a change in need when schools closed during the pandemic.', 'Parents were telling her they were struggling because their children were no longer getting a hot meal at school and they were using more electricity at home.', '"People were really feeling the pinch, that\'s when we applied to be a food bank," she said.', 'Demand has gone up as inflation has hit, and on Monday they gave out between 25 and 30 meals.', '"We\'re getting more people coming through the door with families, we\'re getting more people staying longer," said Sarah.', '"They\'re lonely, they\'re cold. It\'s open to anybody who wants companionship."', 'For more on this story watch Wales Live tonight at 22.35GMT on BBC One Wales and iPlayer', 'Â© 2022 BBC.
