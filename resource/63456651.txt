Health professionals say it can impact on the quality of care they can deliver.', 'Staff shortages also lead to delays in the whole system. It can mean longer waits for appointments, operations and getting home from hospital.', "Earlier this year the Scottish government published its workforce strategy for health and social care. The target is to grow the NHS workforce over the next five years by 1%. So, it's no surprise that winter plans also include aims to recruit additional staff including some for overseas.
