['<b class="ssrcss-hmf8ql-BoldText e5tfeyi3">TikTok has revealed its breakout artist of the summer - an 18-year-old rapper who says comedy was key to his success.</b>', 'How do you create a viral song on TikTok? Well, the person to ask would be 18-year-old rapper Stepz.', 'The Londoner created one of the sounds of the summer with his second single <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/Cramp-Dat-7053834335313136389" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Cramp Dat,</a> which samples Soulja Boy\'s 2007 hit Crank That.', 'TikTok says the track dominated their weekly hot tracks chart, taking the number one spot for seven weeks. ', 'And like most things on the platform, it\'s inspired thousands of people to take on a dance challenge - inspired by the song\'s lyric "I got a cramp". ', '"I can\'t lie, Cramp Dat was just to get some more exposure out there," Stepz tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. ', '"Cramp Dat is not even my favourite song out of my own. It was more a thing where I know that people will want to dance."', "Stepz's music might be racking up thousands of listens, but his relatable TikToks - think point of view videos and short comedy sketches - have also earned him more than two million followers on the app.", '"I would use my comedy to promote my music as well. So most people think that I was a comedian before music, but the comedy was literally just to get my music more out there," he says. ', "And Stepz is glad he's also famous for his jokes.", '"A lot of rappers in the UK are just talking about how many guys they\'ve done this and that to, but I don\'t have to put an image on myself as if I\'m someone that I\'m not, because I do comedy," he adds.', '"And people know that this is who I am. I can really just make music and talk about how I feel."', 'He maintains that some negative stereotypes still surround rap.
