No sanitiser for the trays, no sanitiser for anything," he said.', '"PPE was not mandated despite managers wearing HAZMAT suits. We were not even provided masks or disinfectant.', '"These safety issues exposed workers in Australia, and more broadly, to serious risks of contracting and spreading Covid," he added.', '"I was really passionate about safety, and wanted to see my fellow workers go home safely each day."', 'Mr Seremetidis alleges concerns raised with management went unaddressed and eventually he directed a group of workers to stop working.', '"On the day that this occurred, I was stood down immediately.
