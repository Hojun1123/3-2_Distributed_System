', "People can be infected even if they've had Covid before, but jabs are helping to protect against serious illness.", 'Health officials are urging anyone over 75 who has not had a vaccine or booster in the past six months, to get one.', 'In the week ending 24 June, the ONS estimates Covid rates were:', 'Sarah Crofts, from the ONS, said: "Across the UK we\'ve seen a continued increase of over half a million infections, likely caused by the growth of BA.4 and BA.5 variants."', 'In its analysis of England, it found infections were going up in all regions and in all age groups.', 'In Scotland, which has had the highest Covid rates in the UK since the end of May, the rise in infections may be slowing slightly.
