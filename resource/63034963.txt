['<b class="ssrcss-hmf8ql-BoldText e5tfeyi3">About one in five women have mental health struggles when pregnant or after giving birth. For some the experience can be overwhelming, but there is help available. As part of a series focusing on west Cumbria, the BBC has spoken to some of those who found light at the end of the tunnel.</b>', 'While pregnant with her daughter, Becca Todd had terrifying recurring nightmares that she and her baby would die.', '"The most common one was of my baby slipping out of her cot and somehow getting hanged," the 25-year-old from Maryport recalls.  ', '"Another was driving over a bridge and the car going into water and us drowning. ', '"Nearer Asha\'s birth there was also the fear of my baby being deprived of oxygen."', 'As Becca was expecting during the height of the Covid pandemic, she also had to contend with feelings of isolation.', 'Some of her fears were not unfounded, her labour was traumatic when the placenta got stuck and she had to have an epidural so it could be removed.', 'Although Asha was delivered safely Becca continued to struggle with anxiety and exhaustion so went to her GP.', 'She was given medication for depression and also referred to the First Step talking therapies service.', 'Becca was offered cognitive behavioural therapy and, even though Covid meant her sessions were on the phone, her feelings improved. ', '"I was helped to make an action plan for times when I felt I couldn\'t cope," she said. "I put together my \'happy box\' that I could go to when I didn\'t feel well.', '"It has chocolate and photos of Asha in it, things to boost my mood. I was advised to make time for myself which didn\'t involve the baby, so I took up swimming.', '"I was also encouraged to write down a positive thought every day."', 'First Step is run by Cumbria, Northumberland, Tyne and Wear NHS Foundation Trust which provides mental health support across the north of England.', 'Clinical manager Leanne Huntley says: "About one in five women struggle with their mental health during pregnancy or after giving birth.', '"It can be a really difficult time and if you are struggling, you are definitely not alone.

', '"I would feed her for a few minutes then she would fall asleep," she recalled. "Then she would wake up and want to be fed again.', '"I was feeling resentful, like I never got five minutes to myself to eat or have a shower."', 'First Step recommended Becca approach the Happy Mums Foundation which runs support groups for expectant mums and parents experiencing mental health problems.', 'When Asha was five months, Becca joined up and then reached a turning point.', '"I realised I wasn\'t alone and other mums had similar stories of fears for their babies."', 'She continued to breastfeed successfully, but knows that many new mums struggle and feel judged if they do not manage.', '"It\'s fine to chose what\'s best for you and your baby, it doesn\'t matter what route you take, fed is best."', 'Becca began volunteering for the foundation and after two years joined the staff as a peer support coordinator.', 'She then helped set up a new group in Workington in January 2021.', '"We are always on the look out for new people to join us and there are always biscuits," said Becca.
