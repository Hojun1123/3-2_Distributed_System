', 'Some used black rubber tubes to help float along the muddy brown water, which at times reached up to their chests, others stepped gingerly through it. ', 'Imadullah, a chef, with his young son perched above his shoulders, had just managed to reach his family home. All their belongings were piled up, covered in mud and largely unusable.
