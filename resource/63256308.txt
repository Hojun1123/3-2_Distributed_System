', '"This means that from 1 November 2022, energy bill support will be provided to Northern Ireland residential customers, by reducing the underlying cost of electricity. ', '"Although we now must substantially increase our underlying price to reflect the current market, the implementation of the EPG will mean our customers will see a reduction in their billed tariff level of 10%." ', "The NI Utility Regulator said with the cap in place the typical Power NI customer's bill will be 38% lower than the equivalent in Great Britain and 48% lower than the equivalent in the Republic of Ireland.", '"Further tariff reviews for all suppliers are likely given the ongoing volatility of wholesale prices and the effect of changes to the EPG discount - the latter to be announced by the UK Government every three months going forward," John French, Chief Executive of the Regulator added.', '"Separate to the energy price guarantee support, we are working with the UK Government and local energy suppliers to ensure that the £400 Energy Bill Support Scheme payment is paid to Northern Ireland consumers as soon as possible."', '© 2022 BBC.
