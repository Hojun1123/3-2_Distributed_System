I want to make memories and capture these moments with my family because the reality is, my boys are going to grow up not knowing their dad and that breaks my heart."', 'Irwin has also taken out life insurance and encouraged other people to do the same.', '"That has helped so much and when I leave this planet, I\'ll do so knowing Jess and the boys are in a house that is fully paid off and there\'s a bit of money in the bank for them to live off."', 'Reacting to the news, his Place in the Sun co-host Jasmine Harman said: "Words can\'t fix much, but what lovely words of support you have had here [on social media] Jonnie.', '"I know you know this already, but I am here for you my dear friend, and Jess and the boys.
