The crew on that occasion included Jeff Bezos himself and his brother, Mark.", 'Flight 18 gained international attention when it carried the Star Trek movie actor William Shatner aloft.', "Monday's mission was uncrewed. The capsule was carrying 36 payloads from academia, research institutions, and students from across the globe -  largely paid for by the US space agency Nasa.", "These experiments were aiming to exploit the particular conditions of weightlessness experienced at the top of the capsule's routine apogee of a little over 62 miles (100km).", 'Had people been on board during the abort, they would have experienced a sharp jolt at the moment of separation but should have been none the worse for their experience on landing.', "The Federal Aviation Administration, which licenses commercial spaceflight in the US, said it would be investigating Monday's incident. ", '"Before the New Shepard vehicle can return to flight, the FAA will determine whether any system, process or procedure related to the mishap affected public safety. This is standard practice for all mishap investigations," its statement read.', 'Â© 2022 BBC.
