', "Energy supplier Octopus Energy, which trialled National Grid's proposals, said smart meter customers who reduced their consumption on evenings when demand is highest manged to save cash.", 'It said consumers on average saved 23p per each two-hour trial window, but some participants saved up to £4.35. ', '"However, savings over winter could potentially be much higher if this becomes a real service, but of course this depends on how much National Grid would pay households per kWh," the company said.', 'Greg Jackson, chief executive and founder of Octopus Energy said traditionally at times when demand was high, National Grid would pay large companies to reduce their usage, or pay for "diesel generators to switch on to produce electricity".', 'He said the new plan, which he hopes will be in place this winter, wasn\'t "life changing stuff", but would offer households a chance to get paid if they reduced demand on the network.', '"When some people take part in these turn downs, it reduces the price for them but actually by making the system more efficient, it reduces it for everyone.', '"These small amounts add up," he said.', "Russia's invasion of Ukraine has fuelled a massive rise in energy bills and concerns over energy security.", 'Energy firms have been asked to delay the closure of UK coal-fired power plants by the government, which has said it is exploring "a wide range of options to further bolster our energy security and domestic supply".', 'Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng wrote to EDF, Drax and Uniper this month to ask that they temporarily extend the operation of the coal plants, which are used for back-up generation.', 'The UK gets very little of its power from coal, but generates a lot of electricity from gas.', 'National Grid said its hoped the new scheme would help to avoid the need to burn more coal for energy.', 'Reducing your energy bill a little by switching on appliances at a "cheaper" time of day is not, as Octopus boss Greg Jackson says, life changing. Nor is it a new idea.', "But any way to keep costs down will be looked at with interest by consumers who are only seeing their bill go one way at the moment - and that's up.", 'It has long been the selling point of smart meters, that this kind of thing is made easier to monitor and reward when suppliers have a minute-by-record of your energy use.', 'But there will be some safety concerns. For example, a fire caused by a faulty washing machine or tumble dryer is more of a risk to life if it occurs in the middle of the night, when everyone at home is upstairs asleep, than it would during the day.', '© 2022 BBC.
