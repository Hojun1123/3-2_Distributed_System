', 'Ms Scott said her daughter-in-law was having a protracted and difficult birth, and that staff at Leicester Royal Infirmary also wanted her to return to Peterborough.', 'She added: "She (Barbara) had to - in front of the staff there - phone Peterborough direct and speak to a manager, who said \'whatever you do you do not leave Leicester, you stay where you are. We have no beds\'".', 'In a series of audio messages to her family, and shared with permission, Mrs Job described her frustration and worry about the experience.', 'In one recording, she told her relatives: "so Peterborough and Hinchingbrooke have not got enough midwives to be able to help us with our birth safely.
