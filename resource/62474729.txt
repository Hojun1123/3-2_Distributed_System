Not only will the second instalment of that payment arrive this autumn, but I\'ve been clear that we are absolutely committed to bringing an equivalent to the £400 energy bills discount to Northern Ireland as soon as possible to ease the burden on families."', 'The UK Treasury would have ordinarily made the payment via a Barnett Consequential to Northern Ireland, as it had previously done with a £200 energy loan payment scheme.', 'It uses the Barnett formula to calculate additional funding when there are changes to UK government spending that affect devolved services.', 'However, the Treasury said without a functioning government at Stormont to sign off on the money, it was considering other ways of applying the discount.', "It is understood that Stormont's Department for the Economy holds a legal power under the Electricity (Northern Ireland) Order 1992, to direct electricity providers in Northern Ireland to make the payment to consumers.", 'This is being looked at by officials as a possible solution, in line with how the discount is being applied in Great Britain from October.', "However, it is believed Northern Ireland's Utility Regulator, which is responsible for regulating the local energy industries, could have to undertake a public consultation first.
