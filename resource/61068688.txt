['<b class="ssrcss-hmf8ql-BoldText e5tfeyi3">When Emily Hughes moved in to her new house in Peterborough, one of the first things that needed tackling was the heating system.</b>', '"With an ageing boiler, the bills were mounting quickly," she says.', 'To be "ultra-efficient" she decided to install a whole new heating system. Solar panels were fitted to the house, along with an air source heat pump. The heat pump and panels work together with a passive heating system - a mesh of pipes encased in concrete, that stores heat in summer and slowly releases it over the winter. ', 'Ms Hughes says her heat pump and solar panels make her less vulnerable to energy bill price shocks, but there is still more they could do.', '"We\'d like a battery storage facility to store some of the solar energy for use in the night time - but at the moment the cost (and limited supply of batteries) are proving to be issues."', '<a href="https://www.theccc.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Annex-2-Heat-in-UK-Buildings-Today-Committee-on-Climate-Change-October-2016.pdf" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">According to government data</a>, 85% of UK homes use mains gas for heat, leaving them at the mercy of volatile international gas markets which dictate pricing.

Author, Alison Reddihough, lives in rural Sussex and, until five years ago, was reliant on oil for her heating.', '"Oil prices move quickly - as much as 30p per litre within a week or two," says Ms Reddihough. "Organising oil refills feels a bit like playing on the commodities market. Buying at the wrong time can be costly."', 'Ms Reddihough is fortunate to have a large garden - large enough to install a ground source heat pump. She estimates it has halved the cost of heating her home.', 'Heat pumps use technology similar to your fridge, to take heat from the air outside, or in the ground, and transfer it to your house. <a href="https://www.pwc.co.uk/economic-services/documents/uk-key-trends-2022.pdf" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">According to the consultancy firm PwC</a>, sales of heat pumps are set to triple this year compared with 2020.', "However, they are not the answer to everyone's budgetary problem: they are still very expensive to install, which will out-price many buyers.", 'An air source heat pump can cost between £8,000 and £18,000, and a ground source heat pump between £20,000 and £35,000. That compares with just £1,000 to £3,000 to fit a typical gas boiler.', 'This means that while an air source heat pump could reduce your energy bill by £375 per year, it could, in theory, take up to 48 years to pay for itself. However, as electricity bills rise the cost of installation will be clawed back faster, giving more of an incentive to make the change.', 'In addition, the government is offering £5,000 grants to 90,000 households to help with the cost of an air source heat pump through its <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/check-if-you-may-be-eligible-for-the-boiler-upgrade-scheme-from-april-2022#eligibility" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Boiler Upgrade Scheme</a>.', 'The cost of electricity, as well as gas, is on the rise due to the fact that around 51% of UK electricity comes from gas fired power stations.
