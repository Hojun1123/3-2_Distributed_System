', 'She set up a sustainable womenswear brand in 2018 but soon realised the price of new, sustainable fashion excluded a lot of people, inspiring her to launch SFW.', '"It\'s not about looking at aspiration or exclusivity or new trends, but looking at how everybody can engage with sustainability and fashion in a way that works for them," she added.', "Most of fashion's environmental impact comes from the use of raw materials, such as the farmland used to grow cotton and the amount of oil needed for synthetic materials like polyester.", 'The <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-53465977" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">exploitation of garment workers</a> in both the UK and overseas factories has also been further exposed in recent years.', 'This year marks the second Sustainable Fashion Week, but the first time it has hosted a catwalk.', 'Designer Maria Loria, who is producing one of the catwalk looks, wants to show it can be affordable to consume sustainable fashion, "as opposed to giving all of our money to these big fast fashion corporations that are killing the planet and and exploiting workers". ', 'She hopes the 20 "accessible looks" she has curated from vintage, preloved and upcycled items will help people to think about how they can "reimagine" their wardrobe.', 'Other catwalk looks are being designed by local fashion students, campaign group Black 2 Nature and national fashion retailer Lucy and Yak.', "One community event is the Lockleaze Fashion Show on 20 September at Trinity School in Bristol, being run by the local Barnardo's charity shop.", 'Store associate Karen Edkins said the charity lost a "significant amount of income" during the pandemic; around £1.3m for every week the shops were closed.  ', 'They are hoping the fashion show, made up entirely of second-hand garments, will encourage more fashion-lovers to use charity shops for "sustainable and great value clothes".', '"Shopping pre-loved in charity shops extends the life of textiles and homeware, reduces carbon, waste, and water footprints," added Mrs Edkins.', 'Ms Twine hopes attendees will walk away from SFW feeling "empowered to make positive changes" to their relationship with fashion.', '<i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">Follow BBC West on </i><a href="https://www.facebook.com/pointswest" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Facebook</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">, </i><a href="https://twitter.com/bbcbristol" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Twitter</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2"> and </i><a href="https://www.instagram.com/bbcwest" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Instagram</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">.
