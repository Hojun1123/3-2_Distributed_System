['<b class="ssrcss-hmf8ql-BoldText e5tfeyi3">A new facility to produce and store green hydrogen is set to receive £2.5m in council funding. </b>', 'The unit is being developed by Advanced Automotive Propulsion Systems in Emersons Green, South Gloucestershire. ', 'It aims to transform industries that are difficult to decarbonise, like aviation, shipping and haulage. ', 'Planes, ships and lorries are mostly too large to be powered by existing electric battery technology. ', 'Funding for the plant, due to be operational by spring next year, was given to the council by the West of England Combined Authority (WECA).', '<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w3ct2dqv" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Green hydrogen</a> is very expensive, and there are questions over whether enough hydrogen can be made from renewable energy to make it commercially viable. ', 'It currently accounts for around 1% of the hydrogen produced globally.  ', 'In its very early stages of development, the fuel is made from water by removing the oxygen through a process called electrolysis, which requires a lot of energy. ', 'Most "grey" hydrogen is currently made through fossil fuel-powered electrolysis.', 'A key area of research at the new plant will be hydrogen storage, which includes a facility to cool the volatile gas to below -250C, turning it into a liquid. ', 'Finding a practical method of storing hydrogen is seen as key to making it a viable alternative to fossil fuels for the long-distance transport industry. ', 'South Gloucestershire Council leader Toby Savage said the site would "help us deliver the power demands of zero-emissions advanced propulsion technologies", the <a href="https://ldrs.org.uk/" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Local Democracy Reporting Service</a> said. ', 'Speaking at a council meeting on Friday, Mr Savage added the facility would create more than 250 jobs, safeguard an existing 50 and bring an extra £30m to the regional economy each year. ', 'WECA mayor Dan Norris, added: "This is a key bit of science and it\'s great that we are looking at a hydrogen production, storage and research facility, making sure that we\'re a leader, not just in the UK but around the world."', '<i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">Follow BBC West on </i><a href="https://www.facebook.com/pointswest" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Facebook</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">, </i><a href="https://twitter.com/bbcbristol" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Twitter</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2"> and </i><a href="https://www.instagram.com/bbcwest" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Instagram</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">.
