', '"We\'ve just been talking to lots of people saying these flamingos are coming and just the passion and energy from people saying \'wow I can\'t believe we\'ve still got the flamingos, where are the original ones\', it\'s just started a bit of a hunt to find out where they\'ve gone," Mr Maloy added.', 'He believes they could have been purchased by someone who lived in Flitwick or Flitton.', '"We would have to talk to the people who have them and see if they might be interested in them coming back temporarily, or permanently in some form - or maybe they do a bit of a tour around Luton, just to play a part of our heritage," he added.
