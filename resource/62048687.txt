The Conservative MP for Tamworth - who denies misconduct - has also faced previous allegations about his behaviour.', "Following the resignation, No 10 - and a series of government ministers - initially denied that Boris Johnson was aware of specific complaints against Mr Pincher before appointing him as deputy chief whip. (No 10 is the prime minister's office and briefs journalists on his behalf).", 'But Lord McDonald - a former top civil servant in the Foreign Office - accused No 10 of not telling the truth and stated that Mr Johnson was briefed "in person" about a "formal complaint" into Mr Pincher\'s conduct in 2019, when Mr Pincher was a Foreign Office minister.   ', 'The government now says the prime minister was indeed briefed at the time but could not "recall this" when the latest allegations emerged last week. Mr Johnson has confirmed this and says he "bitterly regrets" not acting on the information. ', 'The story broke in the Sun newspaper.

', 'She said: "To the best of my understanding, the prime minister has not been aware of specific allegations against Chris Pincher."', 'She was asked how she knew this and said - after a number of questions - that the information came from "somebody from the Number 10 press office".', "The following day, Will Quince - the minister for children and families - appeared on the BBC's Today Programme and was also asked whether the prime minister knew about the allegations before making the appointment.", 'He said: "I anticipated you asking this question. Both last night and this morning, I asked No 10 both clearly and firmly for answers on this and I have been given a categorical assurance that the prime minister was not aware of any specific allegation or complaint against the former [deputy] chief whip at the point at which he was appointed."

', 'He reiterated: "On the specific allegations, the prime minister did not know."', 'By 12:30 on Monday, No 10 had changed its line.

The letter said: "The original No 10 line is not true and the modification is still not accurate."', 'He also appeared on the Today programme to say that a group of Foreign Office colleagues told him in 2019 that Mr Pincher had behaved inappropriately, that a complaint had been upheld and Mr Pincher had apologised. ', '"I briefed the relevant senior official in the Cabinet Office," he said. "I know that the senior official briefed the prime minister in person because that official told me so at the time."
