This will be spent, it says, on upgrading existing routes which will cut journey times and increase capacity much sooner than the previous plans.', 'In February 2020, while confirming that HS2 would go ahead, Mr Johnson appeared to hint to MPs that there could be alterations. ', 'He said that "something has to change" as the HS2 plan at the time would effectively condemn the North "to get nothing for 20 years".', '"The question is how we can bring a transport revolution to the North sooner," he added.', 'However, <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/debates/?id=2021-02-10c.325.0" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">in February this year</a>, Mr Johnson told MPs the project was going ahead: "I can certainly confirm that we are going to develop the eastern leg as well as the whole of the HS2."

Cheaper options on Northern Powerhouse Rail make up much of the rest. ', 'But estimates of costs of big rail projects are notoriously unreliable. When HS2 was first announced, the whole thing was only supposed to cost about £33bn.', "Nonetheless, some might argue it's hard to describe any of the £96bn as new money if it's a result of scrapping some rail projects and spending the money on alternatives.", 'In response, the Department for Transport suggested the figures could not be compared because the government was not committed to all of the previous projects in the way that it now has committed to the £96bn. ', 'It also stressed that the previous plans would have drained money away from other services.', 'Bridget Rosewell from the National Infrastructure Commission told BBC News that going ahead with all the rail project proposals would have cost almost twice as much as the government is spending. ', 'She said her organisation had set out some options for these projects and that "the government has gone for one of the lower ones".', 'Some work has already been done on the stretch of HS2 that has been cancelled.', 'The rail consultant Michael Byng estimates that the work done on that stretch so far will have cost about £61m. That is a combination of construction costs, project and design team costs and unforeseen expenses.', 'Higher figures have been reported for this, especially for the cost of buying up property along the eastern leg.', 'But those figures are inflated partly because not all of that stretch has been cancelled and partly because the property bought can be sold again, which should recoup some of the costs.', '<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-41928747" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?
