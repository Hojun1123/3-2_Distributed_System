', '"The building is normally so vibrant, there\'s lots of chatter and there wasn\'t any of that."', 'The picture of her standing alone in an empty auditoriumshowed a difficult period, Ms Stevens said, but "because of the colour and vibrancy it also reflects hope".', '"I\'m normally behind the scenes, I wear black for a living so you notice me as little as possible, so [the painting] really is also seeing me in a different light," she added. ', '"It\'s really humbling that I\'m now captured in something that will be in the building for years to come." ', 'Keegan said: "I had always meant to paint the auditorium but I imagined it would be full of people.', '"The lone figure with the weight of cavernous space around her shows the symbolic emptiness of the time period."', 'On the day the theatre reopened, the artist was there "to capture those first tentative days back", seeing the front-of-house team being briefed in their masks and Sir David Suchet signing in at the stage door behind Perspex.', 'The artist said the residency had given him the "opportunity to really think deeply" about how he painted and what story he was trying to tell. ', 'But reflecting life in the arts during a pandemic had also demonstrated to him what a "close-knit family theatre is".', '"It is a close community that was shattered by Covid and while they rallied round each other they did not have much support from outside," he said.', '"I had great sympathy and compassion for them and it was heart-breaking to see how life stopped."', 'Keegan said that he was now looking for another "creative collaboration". ', 'The exhibition of 12 completed paintings is available for viewing when the building is open.', '<i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">Find BBC News: East of England on </i><a href="https://www.facebook.com/bbcnewseast/" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Facebook</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">, </i><a href="https://www.instagram.com/bbceastofengland/" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Instagram</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2"> and </i><a href="https://twitter.com/bbclookeast" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Twitter</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">.
