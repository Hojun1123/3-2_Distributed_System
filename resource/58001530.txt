['<b class="ssrcss-hmf8ql-BoldText e5tfeyi3">The government has set out plans to change the Northern Ireland (NI) Protocol, part of the Brexit deal Boris Johnson agreed with the European Union in 2020. It came into force in January 2021 and means NI still follows some EU rules. </b>', 'It was aimed at avoiding checks on goods crossing the border with the Republic of Ireland, but it has led to checks on goods arriving in NI from Great Britain (GB). ', 'The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) opposes this because it has created a trade barrier with the rest of the UK. However, following the recent elections, a majority of NI assembly members accept the protocol.', 'Mr Johnson says he wants to "fix" the protocol because it has been "upsetting the balance of the Belfast Good Friday Agreement" (the peace deal signed in 1998). ', 'His comments are in marked contrast to what he said about the protocol at the time he negotiated it.', 'Mr Johnson gave this assessment in the House of Commons shortly after agreeing the terms of the deal, urging MPs to back it.  ', 'But annexes to the protocol set out a long list of EU laws that would apply to NI, including laws dealing with products of animal origin and the EU customs code.

', 'Boris Johnson asserted this in response to a question in Parliament from the DUP\'s Nigel Dodds who said the protocol "drives a coach and horses through the Belfast Agreement" and urged Mr Johnson to reconsider the plan.', 'He reminded the prime minister that he had told the DUP conference in 2018 that "no British Conservative government could or should sign up" to an arrangement with regulatory checks and customs controls between GB and NI. ', 'On 11 May 2022, at a press conference in Sweden, Mr Johnson said that the Good Friday Agreement meant that "things have got to command cross-community support. Plainly the Northern Ireland Protocol fails to do that and we need to sort it out".', 'The protocol has a consent mechanism that means assembly members are asked to vote on it. The first consent vote is due in 2024.

", "In August 2020, Mr Johnson made this pledge - one he's repeated several times.", "But you don't have to have passport controls and officers wearing peaked caps to qualify as a border.", 'NI is being treated differently than the rest of the UK for the trade in goods, as the protocol said it would be. So, there is a trade border in the Irish Sea. ', 'The DUP is deeply unhappy about this, and has adopted the slogan "No border in the Irish Sea".
