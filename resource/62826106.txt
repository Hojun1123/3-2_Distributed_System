', '"With over 300 machines and my passion, I believe I can offer schools an affordable and alternative experience in their own setting, providing the whole school with a day of learning and hands-on experiences."', "The travelling tech museum is expected to visit 10 different schools over the course of two weeks and Mr O'Hare says it was well received at its first location.", '"The pupils were actually just as excited as us; we noticed the expressions on their faces when they came into the hall.  They just wanted to experience everything."', 'Students  amused by the were amused by the primitive nature of the technology but could appreciate how advanced it must once have been.', "For most, the world's first electric car - a Sinclair C5 - proved to be a show-stopper.", 'Year Nine student Jason Allen played a game of 1980s classic, Manic Miner, and was surprised by how enjoyable he found it.', '"It\'s fun, difficult, not like most games I\'ve played.
