But she decided to work from home and set up her own business four years ago.', 'She says working from home has helped her to build her career.', 'When she started her business, she was dealing with life-long health problems.

"That\'s a big reason I wanted to work from home."', 'She adds that when you have mental health issues, sometimes office environments are not compatible with that.', 'She always wanted to go into book publishing and got into that through freelance work.', '"I think the main thing I would say is that you don\'t always have to fit into the mould that society expects you to," she says. "Sometimes it just doesn\'t work for people. Not everyone\'s made to fit what people expect."', '"Try new things," she adds.

', '"It\'s the people you meet, the skills you learn, and it\'s the social time you have there as well," he adds.', 'Ed says he values having more experienced people around the office to learn from.', '"It\'s been essential. I can run things past them and ask questions. Having someone sitting across from you who has been in your shoes when they were starting out. It\'s more natural to talk things through in person, rather than having to send a Zoom invite for a meeting," he says.', '"I\'ve also been able to help out some of our more recent new starters and mentor them too, so it works both ways."', 'Ed says there are mixed views about working from home within his friendship group.
