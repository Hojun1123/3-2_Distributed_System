Avatars in the platform have a simplified, cartoonish appearance.', 'SumOfUs says that virtual assaults can be intensely traumatic.', '"It still counts, it still has a real impact on users," the group\'s campaigns director Vicky Wyatt told the BBC Tech Tent podcast.', 'Ms Wyatt said the researcher subjected to the alleged assault felt that "part of them was really shocked, part of them thought, \'OK, this isn\'t my real body, this is an avatar\' and another part of them thought \'this is really, really important research that I\'m doing, I need to capture this footage\'".', 'The BBC has seen some of that footage. The avatar of the researcher is not in vision, as it is taken from her perspective, but there are two male avatars in the room, one of whom is observing while the other appears very close to her. The pair make lewd comments and share a virtual bottle of drink.', 'There is <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-58749529" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">no single agreed definition of the metaverse,</a> and proponents admit it is a work-in-progress.', 'It draws upon several different pre-existing technologies, including virtual reality and augmented reality.', 'The metaverse is not a single space, and many different 3D virtual environments - including established games and virtual worlds - are said to be part of it.
