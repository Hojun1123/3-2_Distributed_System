', 'They are not thought to be more deadly than any other form of Covid but they do appear to be spreading more quickly.', 'The ONS estimated that about 312,800 people had the virus in Scotland last week - the highest since early April.', 'This was up from 288,200 the previous week, and is the fifth week in a row that the number of people with the virus has increased. ', 'But there are potential signs that the infection rate could be starting to plateau, with the rate at which the virus is spreading beginning to slow down. ', 'The ONS data showed that the infections in Scotland have increased at a slower rate than in other UK nations over the past week, which experts hope could be an indication that they will soon begin to fall again.', 'Sarah Crofts, who works on the ONS\'s Covid-19 infection survey, said: "Scotland continues to have the highest infection rate, although it has recently increased at a slower rate compared to other UK countries. ', '"We will continue to monitor the data to see if this recent rise is starting to slow in Scotland."', 'The ONS stats are collated by testing thousands of people from UK households - whether or not they have symptoms - to estimate how much virus is around.', "Meanwhile, Scotland's largest health board said it has 945 members of staff off work because of Covid.", 'In an email to all staff, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde\'s chief executive said the situation was exacerbated by people being off on holiday, and admitted that the health board was having to work with "less than optimal staffing levels".
