Any woman who arranges her own termination is also liable to face jail, although no woman is thought to have faced criminal charges in years.", 'Last July Ms Prudente told the BBC that a midwife at Mater Dei hospital in Malta had told her that doctors might intervene "when I would be on the \'brink of death\'".
