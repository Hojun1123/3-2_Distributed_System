['<b class="ssrcss-hmf8ql-BoldText e5tfeyi3">North Korea\'s leader Kim Jong-un has appeared with his young daughter in public for the first time, confirming long-rumoured reports of her existence.</b>', 'The girl, believed to be named Kim Chu-ae, joined him at an inspection of a major intercontinental ballistic missile launch on Friday.', 'The pair stood hand-in-hand during the test, which was condemned by the US.', "Mr Kim leads one of the world's most secretive states, and very little is known about his personal life.", 'Several photos were published by North Korea\'s state news agency KCNA, showing the two holding hands while they chat, speaking with officials, inspecting missiles and <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-63672399" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">watching the launch from a viewing deck</a>.', 'The revelation of Kim Jong Un\'s daughter has interested North Korea analysts far more than news it has successfully launched its most <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-63672399" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">powerful intercontinental ballistic missile,</a> thought to be capable of hitting the United States.', 'Why? Because it says so much about the future of the regime and its nuclear weapons programme. Or at least, it raises some intriguing questions.', "Firstly, does this mean that she has been chosen as Kim Jong Un's successor and will one day be running North Korea? Quite possibly. This is a family dynasty, meaning Mr Kim will want one of his children to take the reins.", 'Secondly, why unveil her now? She is still very young.

", "Unveiling her at such a significant launch suggests she will one day play a role in developing the country's weapons. Recently Mr Kim announced that he would not, under any circumstance, be giving up his nuclear weapons. This is a way of showing the world his nukes are here to stay, through to the next generation.", 'Michael Madden, a North Korea expert from the Stimson Center in Washington, told the BBC he believed Chu-ae was aged between 12 and 13.', 'He said the public appearance could be Mr Kim\'s way of showing "that the fourth generation of power succession is going to come through my [blood]line".', "In September, several North Korea experts reported that Chu-ae was shown in a video at the country's National Day celebrations.", "But this was speculation, and the North Korean leadership did not confirm that it was indeed the leader's daughter.", "The first time Chu-ae's existence was ever mentioned was in 2013, after retired American basketball star Dennis Rodman made a controversial trip to North Korea.", 'Mr Rodman said he had spent time with Mr Kim\'s family, relaxing by the sea and had "held their baby Chu-ae".', 'Experts believe Mr Kim may have as many as three children - two girls and a boy, with Chu-ae being the oldest.
