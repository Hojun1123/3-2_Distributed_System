He expected it to last a few weeks, but it went on for two years. ', 'In 2020 the island received just one million foreign visitors, almost all before Bali and the rest of the world went into lockdown in March of that year. Then <a href="https://www.insider.com/bali-records-just-45-international-tourists-2021-report-says-2021-12" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">in 2021 the island reportedly saw just 45 overseas tourists. Yes, just 45 people.</a>', 'Back in February, Mr Kriss watched anxiously as the first international passenger fight for 24 months arrived from Singapore.', 'The expat, who runs a digital marketing and web design business catering to the local tourism industry, even recorded the event on his mobile phone. Like many in Bali, he was optimistic, especially after the island ditched quarantine rules for overseas arrivals in March.', "But as the computer screens in his home office call up the latest visitor numbers, he says there's little cause for celebration.", 'In May, Bali <a href="https://bali.tribunnews.com/2022/06/10/bandara-ngurah-rai-bali-layani-1-juta-orang-pada-mei-2022-penumpang-meningkat-64-persen" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">saw 237,710 international arrivals, up from 114,684 a month earlier,</a> but half the number in the same month in 2019.

And the streets once crowded with Australian, Asian and European tourists are now still eerily quiet.

That was slightly below <a href="https://balistoreluggage.com/blog/umk-bali-ump-indonesia/" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">the minimum wage for employees in Bali.</a>', '"Now sometimes I make 50,000 rupiah in a week. I borrowed money from family to survive, and I don\'t know how I\'m going pay it back," she says.', "At Nusa Dua's shopping and restaurant mall Bali Collection the area that previously held some of the island's top restaurants is now fenced off and deserted. Of the remaining units, about 80% remain unoccupied.", '"Most of these businesses are gone for good," says Kiran Vijay, who runs a crafts and jewellery store at the development.', "He says that the site's management have been very helpful, allowing tenants to be remain rent-free for most of the past two years.

However, the vast majority of these visitors are domestic travellers from other parts of Indonesia, primarily the capital Jakarta and Surabaya, the second-largest city.", "Prior to Covid-19, many of these would have considered Bali too expensive. But with foreigners temporarily out of the picture, they're now able to get discounted rates, and special perks like free helicopter rides exclusively available on Indonesian travel booking sites.", 'Many of the hotel staff are however still working on reduced salaries, some down to as little as 10% of pre-pandemic rates. But for them and the resorts, some income is better than none.', "Meanwhile, many hotel employees and other hospitality workers who were laid off at the start of the lockdowns went back to their home villages to work on the family farm plots. So while some commentators thought that Bali would descend into chaos during the pandemic, life carried on, helped by the island's strong family ties and Hindu culture.", 'Businesses, meanwhile, were able to temporarily suspend operations without fear of bank foreclosure, as most properties in Bali are purchased outright in cash.

She says that while long-haul travel from the UK to destinations such as Bali has been "slower to rebound" compared to holidays within Europe, "the appetite is there and growing".', '"Long haul will see a significant growth in the next 12-18 months, as despite the cost of living crisis, people are still eager to explore, travel and have something to look forward to, banking life long memories."', 'Mr Kriss is certain that - given time - Bali will return again to its former glory. He says there is simply too much on offer in terms of natural beauty, and the friendly, open and tolerate nature of the Balinese people.', '"Bali will come back strong as ever," he says. "I have no doubt about that. It may take years, but Balinese people are patient, and optimism is part of the fabric of their society - they believe in karma."', 'World Cup winner Jürgen Klinsmann invites you to subscribe to his daily World Cup newsletter.', '© 2022 BBC.
