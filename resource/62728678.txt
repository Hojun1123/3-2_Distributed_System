These include long-term deforestation and government failures to make adaptive changes since the last major flooding event in 2010.', "There's no doubt the world will help out in the immediate aftermath of this disaster - but the bigger question is: Will the richer world pay to prevent a repetition?", 'The Pakistani government estimates it will need $7-14bn (£6-12bn) per year, every year until 2050, for adaptation and to build climate resilient infrastructure.
