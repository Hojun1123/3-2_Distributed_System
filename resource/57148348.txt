', 'Other countries where a significant proportion of the population is fully vaccinated, have reported much lower levels of new infections.', 'Over 70% of the population has received at least one dose, and 63% have been fully vaccinated since the rollout began in January.', 'The first vaccine to be used was the Chinese-made Sinopharm, using doses donated by the United Arab Emirates.', 'The Oxford-AstraZeneca jab, produced in India and distributed under the name Covishield, has also been used, and most recently the Russian Sputnik V vaccine was rolled out.', 'Of the doses administered (not including Sputnik), 57% were Sinopharm and 43% Covishield.', "We don't know how many out of those fully vaccinated people who tested positive for Covid had received Sinopharm, and how many had been given AstraZeneca.", 'We do know that about two-thirds of those who tested positive <a href="https://www.nation.sc/articles/8958/interview-with-public-health-commissioner-dr-jude-gedeon-on-the-covid-19-situation-in-seychelles" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">largely had mild or no symptoms</a>, according to the country\'s health commissioner, Dr Jude Gedeon.', "Of those who needed admission to hospital, 80% were people who hadn't been vaccinated, and a majority of these also had other health conditions.", 'The World Health Organization (WHO) says China\'s Sinopharm has an efficacy of 79% against symptomatic infection and <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/the-sinopharm-covid-19-vaccine-what-you-need-to-know" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">is highly effective in preventing severe disease and hospital admission</a>.', "However, there's been generally less data worldwide on Chinese vaccines, and last month, the head of China's Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), George Gau, appeared to question its efficacy.", '"We will solve the problem that current vaccines don\'t have very high protection rates," <a href="https://apnews.com/article/china-gao-fu-vaccines-offer-low-protection-coronavirus-675bcb6b5710c7329823148ffbff6ef9" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">he said at a news conference on 11 April.</a>', 'There are also questions about how effective the AstraZeneca vaccine is against the South African variant which is present in Seychelles.', '<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-56944400" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">A study in South Africa indicated marked reduction in the effectiveness of the AstraZeneca vaccine</a> against mild and moderate disease.

', 'Dr Gedeon, the Seychelles health commissioner, says he believes the rise in cases could be as a result of increased economic activity. ', 'Restrictions were relaxed in March, including the reopening of restaurants and the resumption of school classes.', 'Officials have also suggested Easter celebrations may have contributed, along with people dropping their guard against the possibility of infection, having received one or more doses of the vaccine.

In 2019, there were almost 400,000 foreign visitors.', 'Following a collapse in numbers during the pandemic, tourism is on the increase again.', 'On 25 March, Seychelles announced that visitors could enter without the need to quarantine, although a negative Covid test is still needed and entry restrictions apply for some countries.', 'More than 14,000 visitors arrived in April, far more than in March. But the government has rejected suggestions that this could have led to a rise in cases.', '"There is also no evidence that tourists are bringing new infections into Seychelles," said Dr Gedeon.', 'Â© 2022 BBC.
