['<b class="ssrcss-hmf8ql-BoldText e5tfeyi3">For the third time this year, Sydney has been hit by major floods. Scientists blame intense rainfall on a combination of factors - but, on social media, unfounded allegations of "weather manipulation" have spread widely.</b>', "About as much as eight months' worth of rain has come down in just four days, bringing parts of Australia's largest city to a standstill. ", 'Experts say no single factor can explain this extreme weather, pointing instead to warmer oceans and saturated soils as contributing factors.', 'But conspiracy theorists aren\'t buying it. On social media, they blame the extreme rainfall on "cloud seeding" and "weather manipulation".', "There is no evidence to back up such theories, but this hasn't prevented falsehoods from reaching thousands of people online.", 'Cloud seeding is a real thing. It involves manipulating existing clouds to try and help them produce more rain or snow. ', 'This is done by firing small particles (usually silver iodide) into clouds. Water vapour gathers around the particles and eventually falls as precipitation.', "The technique has been around for decades. It's not infallible, but it's been used all around the world to - for example - help irrigate crops.", 'But there is no evidence to suggest cloud seeding has anything to do with the current rainfall in Sydney. That hasn\'t stopped some TikTok users from denouncing "weather engineering".', 'They say it\'s all part of a government plan to "weaponise" the weather against its own people - a <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-trending-42195511" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">popular conspiracy trope</a> that has been around for years.', '"The idea that this is happening on a widespread scale, and that there is some motive to manipulate the weather is a complete myth," says Dr Ella Gilbert, a climate scientist at the British Antarctic Survey.', 'And yet, this myth seems to have found an audience on various social media platforms.
