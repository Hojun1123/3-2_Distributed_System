Some young people are still banking on a career in the oil industry. Others are focusing on a future in renewable energy. ', 'As politicians argue over a "just transition" to a greener future, thousands of jobs and the future of the planet depend on finding the right answers. ', "At Aberdeen's Robert Gordon University (RGU), drilling and well engineering students are still hopeful of pursuing a career in oil and gas. ", 'The vast majority are from parts of the world where energy transition is not so high up the political agenda - and many have no plans to stay in Scotland after they graduate. ', 'They know that the world is still dependent on fossil fuels to heat homes, fuel vehicles and power industry.

', 'Affan Peshimam, 30, from India, is following in the footsteps of his father who worked in the oil and gas sector in the North Sea.', 'He said: "I love the smell of petrol. I love working offshore away from civilisation."', "And he's convinced that he can enjoy a full career in the industry in India once he's graduated in Aberdeen.", '"There\'s still a lot of oil remaining, at least 30 or 40 years more," he said. "Every time they say the peak has come, I don\'t think so. Maybe for the North Sea.', '"For certain parts of the world where there\'s no oil left, the peak has come. But in Africa and India and the Far East we still have so much reserves left we can\'t just keep them. ', '"Of course we have started some solar but we are still dependent on oil and gas. And coal, obviously."  ', 'Affan is right about the North Sea - production peaked about 20 years ago and since then the UK has gone from producing more oil and gas than it needs, to importing it from other countries. ', 'As prices rise following the Covid pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, this has raised concerns about UK energy security. ', 'It has led to calls from some quarters for more oil fields - like the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-61031088" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">controversial Cambo field</a> - to be opened to offset decades of decline. ', 'Ryan Crighton, of the Aberdeen and Grampian Chamber of Commerce, said the growing energy deficit leaves Scotland with two choices: "To produce more domestically, with full control over the regulatory environment in which it is extracted. Or to import more energy from overseas, without the tax revenues that the North Sea gives us. ', '"The latter makes little economic sense and even less environmental sense."', 'Others - including First Minister Nicola Sturgeon - argue that accelerating the transition to more renewable forms of energy is the best response to the crisis. ', 'Eta Etta-Agbor, another drilling and well engineering student at RGU, knows she is acquiring skills which could be transferred to the renewables industry, if it comes to it.

', '"What we are learning here, I could easily switch into the (renewables) industry but the fact is there will still be lots of drilling taking place," she said. ', 'And she pointed to the importance of gas in generating electricity - the UK, and England and Wales in particular, still relies on it heavily. ', '"Gas is essentially like the next fuel that can be used for electricity so we\'ll still be drilling more gas in the future so I\'ll still be relevant in the industry," she said.

', 'The projects - many backed by big name oil and gas firms with the deep pockets necessary to invest in new technology - will also need a new workforce.

She said they are "quite convinced" enough jobs can be created in its alternative energies business to replace those lost by the shift away from oil. ', '"We have real ambition to make sure that we can provide opportunities for people to move from one aspect of the energy work that we do to another."', "It's not just the engineers on the rigs who are seeing huge changes in Aberdeen's energy industry. ", "Many of those in businesses which have long supported oil and gas firms' traditional operations are adapting to changing priorities. ", 'Among them are firms like North Star, which started out in fishing before the oil boom of the 1970s saw them dip their toe in new waters.

It\'s why we\'ve made investments in new facilities specific to the renewables industry for example."', 'Those new facilities at their Portlethen site, south of Aberdeen, focus on rope and climbing skills as well as more traditional needs like firefighting.', 'Workers are more likely to travel to wind turbines by boat rather than helicopter which is more common for rigs.', 'Paul adds that demand for renewable skills is growing but "for us, oil and gas will still remain a big part of the throughput of training that we do."', '© 2022 BBC.
