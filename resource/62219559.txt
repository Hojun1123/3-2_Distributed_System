Using alternative fuel suppliers is another option.', 'Sharon Graham, Unite general secretary, said AFS was "wholly owned by incredibly wealthy energy companies who are entirely able to provide our members with a decent pay increase".', 'Unite said its members had not received a pay rise for three years, adding AFS had made an offer of a 10% increase which was "rejected by members as it did not meet their expectations".', 'Prices are currently rising at the fastest pace for 40 years, prompting many unions and workers in the UK to ask for pay increases.

There are concerns that <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-62218706" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">wage rises to cope with the current cost of living could fuel further inflation</a>.', 'AFS is a joint venture operation, which includes firms BP, Total Energies, Q8 Aviation and Valero Energy. ', 'A statement from AFS said the strikes would "restrict our ability to refuel planes" at Heathrow.', 'The company said it had "put on the table what we believed to be a fair and reasonable offer".', 'It said Unite had "omitted" a number of elements of the pay off which included bonus, overtime increases and backdating of pay.', '"We know that our employees are concerned about the rising cost of living, as are many people employed in other sectors up and down the country," it added.', '"We urge Unite to postpone industrial action to engage in further mediation. Nevertheless, we are continuing to work towards a resolution."', 'Unite regional officer Kevin Hall said the dispute over pay was "entirely of AFS\' own making".', '"It initially refused to enter into negotiations and only belatedly made an offer which workers judged entirely unacceptable," he said.', 'But he added: "Even at the eleventh hour strike action could be avoided if AFS made a substantially improved offer."', 'Â© 2022 BBC.
