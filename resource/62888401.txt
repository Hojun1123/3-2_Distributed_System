She was a very special little pony, wilful, she had her own idea on how things should be done. You couldn\'t get Valkyrie to do anything she didn\'t want to do, she was very strong-willed.', '"We actually had two foals out of her - my mother bred from her - that made other children great starting ponies, so Valkyrie was very special in a lot of young horse people\'s lives."', 'He said it was "bringing back a lot of memories" talking about those times.', '"The Queen used to visit at least once a year," Mr Balding recalled. "After the prize thoroughbreds we would wheel in Valkyrie and the Queen would give her a Polo. Her eyes would light up and a big smile when she saw Valkyrie.', '"The great thing about Valkyrie was she was very safe. With both her (my sister) and myself sat on her she would not flinch. She was fairly bomb-proof.', '"Valkyrie helped us develop the passion we have and probably follow the career path we have, so she was instrumental from that point of view.', '"Of all the gifts probably the Queen\'s received that would be a good one. Valkyrie was the gift that kept giving."', 'He added: "She lived here the rest of her life and died a ripe old age, I think she was almost 40, she had a long happy life at Kingsclere."', 'Agnes Priest\'s sister Cathie Jamieson recalled of 1960: "It was a day of excitement for the whole island and especially for us with my sister having the honour of presenting the foal to the Queen. ', '"She (Agnes) was very excited, she did very well. I remember her dress, she wore a little frock and it was blue and white, and there was a touch of red in it so it must have been specially for the Queen, for the flag."', 'She added: "It is just amazing to think that the pony from up here went all the way down south and princes learned to ride on it and also a champion jockey."', 'The Queen visited Shetland and Orkney three times each.', "On County Show day in Orkney in 1978 it is estimated that two thirds of the island's population turned out to see her.", '<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-62861617" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">What next?
