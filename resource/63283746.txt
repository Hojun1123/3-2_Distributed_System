It said properly cooked poultry and poultry products, including eggs, are safe to eat.', 'The government stopped short of asking all bird owners to bring their animals inside, a measure already in place in the east of England. ', 'It said that keepers with more than 500 birds would need to restrict access for non-essential people on their sites. Workers would need to change clothing and footwear before entering bird enclosures and site vehicles would need to be cleaned and disinfected regularly to limit the risk of the disease spreading.', 'Avian influenza spreads naturally in wild birds. These can spread it to poultry and other captive birds when they migrate.', '"Bird keepers have faced the largest ever outbreak of avian flu this year and with winter brings an even more increased risk to flocks as migratory birds return to the United Kingdom," the chief veterinary officers of England, Scotland and Wales said in a joint statement.', '"Scrupulous biosecurity and hygiene measures is the best form of defence."', 'The Wiltshire Wildlife Trust has found 20 dead wild birds at its Langford Lake reserve, most of them Canada geese.

The trust was asking the public to stick to footpaths and not to walk through bird faeces.', '"It\'s very hard with wild populations. You can\'t control where they come from," he said. "We have large numbers of Canada geese and lapwings and more, and you don\'t know what could be potentially coming and going from site."', 'He asked members of the public to "be vigilant" and to record any sightings by taking a photo and emailing it in with a location.', '"From a wildlife perspective this is the worst we\'ve ever seen," he said. "It could be a very long winter unfortunately."', 'Â© 2022 BBC.
