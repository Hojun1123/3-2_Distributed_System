"If we are not able to reverse the present trend, we will be doomed."', 'The conference, known as COP27, will bring together countries to discuss tackling climate change.', "Mr Guterres said that current global problems such as inflation, Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the high prices of energy and food were distracting governments.", '"Bring back climate change to the centre of the international debate," he urged.', 'The UN chief insisted that leaders should not abandon key goals, including keeping global temperature rise to 1.5C, in order to avoid the worst effects of climate change.', 'He said he would like to see both King Charles III and new UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak attending COP27, saying King Charles has been a "constant voice" calling attention to the problem of climate change.', 'He also called on the US and China to work together at the conference, saying the world relies on their leadership.

He also praised the leadership of young people around the world in calling attention to climate change.', 'The interview coincided with a report warning that in 2021 there were more greenhouse gases warming our atmosphere than ever.', 'Atmospheric levels of the three main greenhouse gases - carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide - reached record highs in 2021, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) found.', 'It also said concentrations of the powerful gas methane jumped by the highest amount in 40 years, mystifying experts.', 'The COP27 conference will see global leaders meet in Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt from 6-18 November to discuss what progress has been made on meeting climate goals.', 'Last year at COP26, in Glasgow, governments pledged to cut back or stop using fossil fuels, end deforestation, and provide money to developing countries facing the worst of climate change.', 'The negotiations this year will focus on what progress has been made and implementing those promises.', '<i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">Inside the UK, you can </i><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/l00567ch/tackling-climate-change" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">watch the interview in full</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2"> on the BBC\'s iPlayer.</i>', '© 2022 BBC.
