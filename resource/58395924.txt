', 'As our world moves increasingly online a new firm needs a moniker that also works well as a internet domain name. You cannot just offer a good product or service - shoppers also have to be able to find and remember you.', 'This issue of dreaming-up a company name is topical because the number of new firms being set-up soared during the pandemic.', 'In the UK, <a href="https://www.rebootonline.com/digital-pr/assets/the-most-company-incorporations-past-year/" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">one study found that 835,494 new companies were registered in the year to January 2021.</a> That was 41% higher than the previous 12-month period.', 'Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/17/business/pandemic-entrepreneurs.html" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">4.4 million businesses were reported to have been set-up in the US last year,</a> 24% more than in 2019.

These 'naming' sites include Alter, BrandBucket, Frozen Lemon, Wix and Zyro.", '"Demand for business names went up [in the pandemic] as entrepreneurs were sitting there and thinking what to do next," says Deven Patel, the founder of Alter.', 'Mr Patel says these entrepreneurs see the challenges experienced by \'bricks and mortar\' firms "and realise there is relatively more they can do online. And so the majority of new companies [launched] now are online."', '"But then you have to stand out. Consumers online just see 100 companies selling the same thing, but with a good name you stand out - and that gives you much more of an advantage now than it would in the past."', "Alter's website starts by asking the user to type in a word connected to the type of business they want to create. It then offers a number of suggestions that it has already registered, and how much they would cost to buy from it.", 'For example, if you type "wine" it gives you 10 options including searchwine.com for $2,099 (£1,523).', 'Many firms are, however, still coming up with their own novel names.

They were still trounced by Apple and Android handsets.", 'Prof Botti adds that the alternative to carefully researching whether a new company name would work is for a firm "to just go with its guts".', '"Then, that new name becomes almost an empty vessel, and it is what you put in that name that matters."', 'Brand expert, Rebecca Battman, founder of agency RBL, says that picking a good name for a business is harder than most people realise.', '"Few people truly understand how hard it is to find or create a name that is easy to say, easy to spell, has meaning, conveys personality, is protectable, supports a strong domain name, and will be able to grow with the business as its strategy evolves," she says.', 'And Ms Battman adds that when it comes to the domain name, the sweet spot is definitely to get the ".com".', '"While a .com domain isn\'t always necessary, it makes life so much easier in the long run," she says.
