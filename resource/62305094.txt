And with winter looming, as well as Gazprom's announcement on Monday, ministers were under even more pressure to act. ", "Meanwhile, there's also the matter of Hungary. It was the only country to finally oppose the agreement, raising questions over whether they will even try and implement the plan. ", "Not only this but, in recent days, Budapest's foreign minister met his Russian counterpart in Moscow to request additional gas supplies.
