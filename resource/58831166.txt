What we are doing is committing to ensure that we\'re looking at a wide range of sources for that investment. It can\'t all come from public funds.', '"Even I might blanche at the idea if (Mr Griffin) comes forward with a proposal for a £33bn tax rise so we can fund it all from public sources."', 'The strategy claims that at least 16,400 jobs will be created through the need for different heating sources by 2030. ', 'Liam Kerr, Scottish Conservative spokesman for net zero, energy and transport, said: "The SNP-Green coalition are failing to say where they\'ll get the money required and are preparing to saddle homeowners and businesses with a bill for over £30bn.', '"It is ironic that the anti-business Green minister is now going to have to rely on the private sector to bail him out if his strategy is to succeed."', 'Holly O\'Donnell, climate and energy policy manager at WWF Scotland, said: "This new strategy to cut emissions from our homes and buildings is an essential step to dealing with the climate emergency.', '"Soaring gas prices are an urgent reminder that the sooner we can banish polluting and volatile fossil fuels from our homes the better."', 'She added that the new regulations would need to be accompanied by grant support to make the transition to green homes fair to everyone.', '© 2022 BBC.
