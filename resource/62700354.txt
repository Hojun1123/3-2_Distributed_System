', 'Six ships - each capable of carrying about 1,600 shipping containers - will operate on the route, which was established as a response to growing global supply chain pressures.', 'The new service with three sailings per month in each direction is expected to cut the journey time from about 60 days to an estimated 33 by eliminating unscheduled port congestion delays in Rotterdam.', 'Greenock Ocean Terminal, which opened in 1969, is currently responsible for the handling of 100,000 containers a year', 'Jim McSporran of Peel Ports, which operates the Clydeport in Greenock - Scotland\'s deepest container terminal, said it was "great to finally welcome this vital service".', 'He said: "We believe this partnership will prove to be a hugely positive development for businesses and customers, as well as boosting the wider supply chain, and we look forward to continuing to work with our partners on this service in the coming months."', 'The direct link between the two countries was established in a partnership between KC Liner Agencies, DKT Allseas and China Xpress.', 'David Milne, KC Group Shipping managing director, said the company has been "amazed at the level of immediate interest" in the route.', 'He said they needed the support of Scottish importers and exporters to "safeguard the long-term future" of the new service.', '"Our direct trading link to China cuts through frustrating transhipment delays, which is a massive boost for Scottish businesses and can only help consumers in these difficult times," he said.
