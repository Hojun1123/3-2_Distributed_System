Allowing the cap to rise will help fund targeted support for some 8 million low income households.', 'Universal support payments will end but there will be targeted support for those on low incomes and pensioners. ', 'The energy industry - including energy generators - will also be hit with a significantly expanded windfall tax to help pay for the support.', 'Mr Hunt will use his speech to set out plans to repair the UK\'s battered public finances, which need about £54bn over two years, but will claim to be taking a "compassionate" and "balanced" approach.', 'He will claim the UK is not "immune" to the global economic crisis "but with this plan for stability, growth and public services - we will face into the storm".', 'The final figures will be published as his statement is delivered but it is expected that around 55% of the measures will be spending cuts and 45% will be tax rises.

', 'The biggest spending squeezes are expected to be deferred until after 2025, beyond the next general election.', 'The government is also expected to give itself longer to meet its debt and spending targets - five years instead of three currently.', "The chancellor is likely to argue that this is not a return to the 2010 Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government's policy of austerity, with the balance of spending cuts to tax rises 80% to 20% under then-Chancellor George Osborne. ", 'But he is coming under pressure from some Conservative MPs, who argue tax rises are unnecessary and risk tipping the UK into a deep recession.', 'The freezing of levels at which people pay various taxes will be a big theme of the statement. As a result of inflation and pay increases, people will end up paying more tax. ', 'The threshold when the highest earners start paying the top rate of tax will be lowered to £125,000 from £150,000. ', 'With inflation - the rate at which prices rise - now running at a 41-year high, many departments will see their budgets squeezed with below-inflation increases.
