", 'In March, Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced he would abolish VAT (a tax paid when buying goods) on domestic solar panels, insulation and heat pumps but would not "immediately be able to apply it to Northern Ireland".', 'This is because NI follows rules on VAT set by the EU - which has a minimum rate of 5% (unless certain products have been exempted - something it is planning to do for "green" products such as solar panels).', 'The fact NI would have to follow these rules was <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/840230/Revised_Protocol_to_the_Withdrawal_Agreement.pdf" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">made clear in the text of the protocol</a>.
