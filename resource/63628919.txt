That has bumped the numbers up here… It is a great thing for us."', 'Dr Wali said he anticipated not everyone would feel the same, but that generally the community had been welcoming. ', '"People go out of their way to help them," he said.', '"Even people privately on their own have gone out of their way to teach them English to help them, especially around Christmas, they bring gifts to them… they are being welcomed and taken care of."', 'The visit to the Coleraine Muslim Association was organised by Fergal Quinn, ethnic communities officer from the Building Communities Resource Centre.', '"When we were setting up the programme, we wanted to have four venues where people wouldn\'t normally frequent," he said.', '"It was a revelation to me that there was a mosque or Islamic Centre in Coleraine as it was for a lot of the participants….and yet they\'re such a vibrant and important part of the Causeway Coast and Glens community.', '"Ignorance sometimes is just a lack of knowledge."', 'The group also visited the Orange Hall in Dervock, the LGBTQ+ society at Ulster University and CAN Ballymoney, an organisation that supports people with learning difficulties.', '"The whole idea is for people to go into buildings and meet parts of our community who they wouldn\'t normally engage with." said Fergal.', '© 2022 BBC.
