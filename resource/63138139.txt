One week later, I was diagnosed with hormone receptive breast cancer."', 'Dave said he was scared and found it tough to tell his children.', 'He had a mastectomy and lymph node removal, followed by chemotherapy and radiotherapy.', '"Having cancer was a positive experience in many ways, as it made me reassess things.
