For a start, France would not take in 3,500 refugees it had earlier agreed with Italy to accept in protest at Rome\'s actions. He also said France would take measures to strengthen controls on the border with Italy.', 'His Italian counterpart, Matteo Piantedosi, later hit back - saying his neighbour\'s actions were "totally incomprehensible" as Italy had taken in some 90,000 migrants this year alone.
