", 'In April, it said it had repaid lenders and exited a one-time debt restructuring plan that was implemented last year. ', "This is the second tragedy to hit the Mistry family in just four months - Cyrus Mistry's father Pallonji Mistry had died in June at the age of 93.", 'Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi called Mistry\'s sudden death "a big loss to the world of commerce and industry". ', '"He was a promising business leader who believed in India\'s economic prowess," he tweeted.', "Several other ministers and political leaders also tweeted their condolences to Mistry's family.

India's top court had ruled in the Tata group's favour  - but the boardroom coup and the reasons for it remain shrouded in mystery. ", "When Mistry took over as the chairman of Tata Sons in 2012, he became only the second non-Tata top boss of the firm.

No one had an unkind word to say about Cyrus Mistry," says Amit Tandon, who runs a corporate advisory firm.', "But the changes he tried to make, some analysts feel, may have not gone down well with the old guard at the firm, eroding support for Mistry. What everyone agrees on, however, is that the situation could have been handled better. Mistry accused the company of mismanagement and oppressing minority stakeholders. Tata Sons, in turn, alleged that he spoke out in public only after he was removed from the post, and didn't make the changes he needed to while leading the company. ", 'The ensuing feud was so acrimonious that in 2020, the Shapoorji Pallonji group - run by Mistry\'s family - said it was starting the process of ending its 70-year long association with the Tata Group with a "heavy heart". Now analysts are watching to see how Mistry\'s sudden death will affect his family group, which was just emerging from a shadow cast by heavy debt in the past few years.', 'Â© 2022 BBC.
