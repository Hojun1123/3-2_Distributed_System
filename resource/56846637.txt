', 'It is not necessarily the case that all of the people who successfully applied for settled status are still in the UK.', 'The scheme has been successful, but has also highlighted how poor our understanding is of the number of EU nationals in the UK, with implications for both immigration policy and the labour market.

They can apply for:', 'It is also important to note that smaller numbers of applications were repeats, invalid, or were rejected. And some non-European family members of EEA citizens can also apply.', 'In many areas, including parts of West Sussex, Wolverhampton and numerous London boroughs, the number of applicants was more than 80% higher than the estimated local population of EU nationals.  ', 'And some nationalities stood out. More than 760,000 applications have been approved for Romanians in the UK, for example, while the estimate of the resident Romanian population is only about 400,000.', "We don't know, but the settlement scheme has given us the best estimate we've ever had, because everyone has been asked to apply.

So, it wasn't just the government that didn't know the real numbers.
