['<b class="ssrcss-hmf8ql-BoldText e5tfeyi3">Oscar-winning designer Jenny Beavan has said gender bias is behind an "extraordinary" pay gap between costume designers and male-dominated jobs on films and TV shows.</b>', '"I think it\'s because we\'re mainly women," said the British designer, who won her third Oscar earlier this year.', 'The basic rate for TV designers was lower than "the man who brings your tea and your breakfast muffin", she said.', 'She had the words "Naked without us" written on one sleeve at the Oscars.', "That's the slogan of a campaign by the US Costume Designers Guild for fairer pay.

That\'s just extraordinary," she said.', '"And we\'re way down, us film lot, even though we do quite a demanding and necessary job."', 'There has been a drive for fairer pay on screen in recent years after revelations that some male actors were being paid much more than their female co-stars.
