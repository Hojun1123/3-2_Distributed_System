', 'Five miles outside Ipswich in the village of Chattisham, a group of local residents meet every month at the Rural Coffee Caravan.', 'The touring caravan, run by a charity, provides social interaction for communities in Suffolk.

It is hard for everybody."', 'Talking about how she will cope during the colder months, she said: "Regarding heating and things, well if I can\'t afford it, I won\'t put it on because I won\'t get in to debt. I\'ve never been in debt in my life. I\'ll just cut back on food as well if I have to. I\'d have a tin of soup and a roll, hopefully that would warm you up.', '"I\'d either wrap myself in a blanket or go to my granddaughter\'s and sit with her if it\'s really cold. I won\'t be a burden to anybody. I\'ll just get on with it, that\'s what we do.

I leave it as long as possible before I put mine on. I have an open fire which does help," she said.', '"It\'s not good. I struggle with bills and stuff like that, but you\'ve just got to get on with it. I work full-time so I\'m not too bad. I\'m not saying I\'m brilliant either, just get on with it.

', '"I have a luxury in my own home. I have solar panels and we have an electric car - the car gets charged from solar panels so the cost of motoring is minimal from that point of view.', '"We may have to cut back on a bit of food, meals out, the luxuries in life.
