Otherwise, we\'re forever in a crisis mode".', 'Tory leadership candidates Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak have also sparred in recent weeks over their respective plans to help people with living costs this winter.', 'Former chancellor Mr Sunak has suggested extending current government plans by spending around £5bn on further targeted payments to pensioners and the low-paid. He has also suggested spending around the same amount on <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-62309017" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">cutting VAT on domestic energy</a>.', "However, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has said her plan to cut taxes - including green levies on energy bills and reversing April's National Insurance rise - is a better way to help people with soaring living costs.", 'A source from the Truss campaign has said she would "target help with energy bills at the poorest".', 'Allies of Truss have also denied that her backer Simon Clarke was suggesting she would withdraw <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-62338543" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">the £400 support payments already announced</a> for this Autumn when he said on the weekend it was "odd" wealthy people would also benefit from the discount.', 'Neither candidate to replace Boris Johnson as prime minister has indicated they plan to freeze the price cap, or extend the windfall tax on oil and gas companies.', "The Treasury is working up options to help with prices over the winter - although Cabinet Office Minister Kit Malthouse has said any decisions will have to wait until Mr Johnson's successor takes office on 6 September.", 'Rejecting suggestions the government was not functioning properly during the leadership race, he said the preparations would ensure the next prime minister is able to take "quick and early decisions" about what to do.', '"Obviously the energy price cap changes won\'t kick in until October - that does give time for our prime minster to take the decisions that are required in early September," he added.', '© 2022 BBC.
