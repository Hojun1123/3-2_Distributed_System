This had not been logged as an incident, reviewed by staff or referred to safeguarding.', 'Managers told inspectors this would be used as an example in future training, however a quarter of staff were not down to complete this for up to six months and bosses had not taken any immediate action.', 'The report found Osprey Ward was dirty with old coffee stains, litter and crumbs on the floor throughout, while Ivy Ward also appeared unkempt with dirty carpets and crumbs.', 'Karen Knapton, CQC head of hospital inspection, said: "The trust has started to make improvements to improve patient care and know what further changes need to be made to keep people safe.
