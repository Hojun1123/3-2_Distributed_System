Every week I\'d be thinking, come on Wednesday, come on Wednesday, because I couldn\'t wait to do it again.', '"It has brought a bit of joy, yeah because losing my arm, being a guitar player was horrendous, it\'s horrendous to be honest with you, I don\'t know how to describe it, but we move on we live on."', 'Covid restrictions meant the two could not meet in person so they worked online to create music.', '"It took a few weeks to write, little by little, but it was really good, Lucie was really patient with me," he added.', 'On Wednesday the pair recorded two songs written and composed by Tim called Computer Music and Pretty in Pink.
