', 'Two years after she contracted the virus, Sarah can only walk very short distances with the help of a stick. ', 'She also finds it hard to catch her breath and becomes easily fatigued, so the mother-of-four relies on her partner and eldest daughters to care for her.', 'New NHS Wales Covid absence rules mean she will only receive half pay from this month and nothing  from November.', 'Hospitals can use their discretion to extend sick pay to full pay "particularly to facilitate a phased return to work", but Sarah said her present state of health meant she was unlikely to be able to return to what she described as her "dream job" in the near future.', '"I can\'t see me being back at work in November and that\'s going to mean zero pay and there\'s nothing I can do about it," she said.', 'She said "abandoned" was the best word to describe her situation, adding: "We went and did a job. This was before the first lockdown, we didn\'t have PPE, that\'s when people were stealing thermometers and hand gels and everything from hospitals.', '"We didn\'t have masks and the focus was all on handwashing and we now know it\'s airborne, so I\'m angry.', '"I was doing my job, I was looking after people, I was doing what the NHS does, it cares and then I got ill."', 'Sarah said she could understand why employers might not want to take on a long Covid sufferer.', '"I can\'t do a job, I\'ll need a nap after this [interview]. There\'s not going to be many employers who\'ll say \'that\'s OK, go and have a nap whenever you like\'.', '"I can\'t focus on things for long enough, I can\'t focus on a computer screen for long enough. What can I do, who will reasonably employ me? I wouldn\'t if I was an employer. I\'m not useful in any way."', 'Sarah spent "thousands of pounds" on private consultations with a specialist cardiologist in Cardiff and treatments including oxygen therapy and acupuncture in a desperate effort to get well, to no avail.', 'Sarah graduated with first class honours in midwifery in 2019.', 'But in March 2020, just four months into her job as a community midwife, she came home from a shift at Neath Port Talbot Hospital and began experiencing symptoms of fatigue which then turned to difficulty breathing.', 'Her partner was so concerned he called paramedics and she was taken into hospital.

My littlest son Seth is 10, he\'ll say \'can we do something at the weekend?\' and I\'ll say maybe."', 'Looking at photographs taken before she contracted Covid, Sarah was a happy, healthy mother and partner who enjoyed the outdoors and went to the gym at least three times a week. ', 'But two years of illness have taken their toll.', 'Sarah said long Covid leaves her so tired and breathless that even taking Seth to a party last weekend was "impossible".
