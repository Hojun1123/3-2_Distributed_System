', '"For a mediocre film, this could have been wounding. But happily, Wilde\'s is largely fantastic: the sort of juicy but accessible studio production that have all but vanished since 1990s."

It\'s just a shame all the effort has gone into a script without much of that 2019 debut\'s disarming freshness".', 'But despite only just getting its debut, the film has already generated a lot of media attention. ', "The hugely successful pop star Styles - greeted by delighted fans in Venice - is in his first leading role, after appearing in 2021's Eternals and 2017's Oscar-winning Dunkirk.", "But while Pugh, Oscar-nominated for 2019's Little Women, walked the red carpet for the premiere, she was notable by her absence at the press conference. She had flown over from Budapest, where she had been filming the Dune sequel.", 'When asked about any possible reluctance from Pugh to take part in the press conference, Wilde preferred to focus on the acting. ', 'She said: "As for all the endless tabloid gossip and all the noise out there, the internet feeds itself, I don\'t feel the need to contribute, I think it\'s sufficiently well-nourished.', '"Florence is a force and we\'re so grateful that she\'s able to make it tonight despite being in production on Dune," she added.', '"I can\'t say enough how honoured I am to have her as our lead."', 'Meanwhile, several <a href="https://twitter.com/korysverse/status/1566971319895351306" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">videos</a> widely shared online suggested that when Styles sat down at the premiere he appeared to spit at his co-star Pine, whose reaction seemed to suggest he had.

They gave an interview last month to Rolling Stone, in which Styles talked about how tough the social media response could be for those associated with him.", '"It\'s obviously a difficult feeling to feel like being close to me means you\'re at the ransom of a corner of Twitter or something," he says. "I just wanted to sing. I didn\'t want to get into it if I was going to hurt people like that."', 'Wilde added his fans are "deeply loving people", and said: "I don\'t personally believe the hateful energy defines his fan base at all. The majority of them are true champions of kindness."', 'Styles\' part was originally meant to have been played by Shia LaBeouf, who Wilde <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-62670696" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">recently said she had fired</a> because his "process was not conducive to the ethos that I demand in my productions".', 'But the US actor <a href="https://variety.com/2022/film/news/shia-labeouf-denies-fired-olivia-wilde-dont-worry-darling-1235350529/" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">denied this</a>, telling Variety he had "quit the film due to lack of rehearsal time".
