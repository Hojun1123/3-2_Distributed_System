', '"It could be driven by genetics or the way their risks are managed," she said.', '"The difference means we need greater awareness in that population that dementia is a concern - and more proactive management of risk factors like hypertension, and more health checks."', '<a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2022/sep/dementia-rates-over-20-higher-among-black-adults-uk-average" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">A recent study by the same researchers,</a> which looked at 20 years\' worth of GP and hospital health records, found black people had a 22% higher incidence of dementia being recorded than white people.
