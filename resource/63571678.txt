', "A report was sent to Mr O'Brien but, the Inquiry heard, he did not read it and no one took steps to check out the abnormality.  ", 'On top of this, the Inquiry was told, a four-month review never took place due to waiting list issues.', 'The patient then attended A&amp;E on 6 July 2010 after suffering from abdominal pain for two weeks.', 'This led to emergency surgery when the swab was found and removed.
