', 'Sinn Féin\'s Colm Gildernew said this was a "disgraceful" way to refer to "genuine concerns" about the decision.', 'The former chairman of Stormont\'s health committee said it was an "extremely disappointing failure by the trust to recruit surgeons" where a need had been identified.

', '"Unfortunately, realistically, us general surgeons just aren\'t that important and the majority of what we deal with is classified as urgent.', '"Even hours travelled to bigger units gives better results than continuing with small poorly resourced units."', 'He said surgeons wanted to work in bigger, better staffed and better equipped units.', 'Dr Brendan Lavery, director of the Western Trust, said the decision was not going to lead to "adverse outcomes", and denied that this was a permanent measure.', 'He said he accepted that many people would be disappointed.', '"This has happened because we were unable to recruit general surgeons.', '"We have tried everything we can. In an ideal world, I would prefer to leave things as they are."', 'He said the trust was currently trying to recruit surgeons.
