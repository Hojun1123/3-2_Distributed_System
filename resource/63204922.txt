Our health services are already under strain."', 'Ms Kinghorn said the Cardiff and Vale region alone had already given out 75,000 vaccine doses.', 'Public Health Wales figures show 66% of care home residents have received their autumn Covid booster, though the figure is as low as 17.5% in Pembrokeshire.', 'The target is that all those eligible will be offered a jab by the end of November, with 363,023 having received theirs up to 5 October.', 'GPs are worried that flu and Covid will add to already increasing pressures on the service, including people on waiting lists reporting their conditions are getting worse.', 'Dr Phil White, vaccination lead for the BMA\'s Welsh GPs\' committee, said there could be a "substantial increase" in cases compared to the past two years, given the experience already in Australia and other southern hemisphere countries.', 'This is often the forerunner of what happens in the winter here.', '"Come December and January, we might well be in the throes of an epidemic unless we ensure everyone who needs to be vaccinated is vaccinated for both influenza and Covid," he said.', 'In addition, the goal is that those eligible will be offered a flu vaccine by the end of December.', 'Among those getting the jab on Monday was Katie, who works in the medical genetics department at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff.', '"We see a lot of immunocompromised patients undergoing chemotherapy," she said.
