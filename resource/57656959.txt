', 'In May, the latest month with published data, US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) recorded its highest monthly total in more than 20 years of just over 180,000 migrants, mostly single adults.', 'The head of homeland security in the US, Alejandro Mayorkas, said in March: "This is not new. We have experienced migration surges before - in 2019, 2014, and before then as well."', 'During the Trump administration, migrant encounters hit a monthly high of more than 144,000 in May 2019.', 'There has also been an increase in the number of children crossing the border since President Biden took office.
