', "The conundrum currently facing the technology community is the UK government's pledge to support the development of tools which could detect illegal pictures within or around an E2EE environment, while respecting user privacy. ", 'Experts have questioned whether it is possible to achieve - and most conclude client-side scanning is the only tangible option. But this destroys the fundamentals of E2EE, as messages would no longer be private.', '"Client-side scanning cannot work in practice," Mr Cathcart said.', 'Because millions of people use WhatsApp to communicate across the world, it needs to maintain the same standards of privacy across every country, he added.', '"If we had to lower security for the world, to accommodate the requirement in one country, that...would be very foolish for us to accept, making our product less desirable to 98% of our users because of the requirements from 2%," Mr Cathcart told BBC News.', 'The EU Commission has <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_22_2976" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">said</a> technology companies should "detect, report, block and remove" child sex abuse images from their platforms.

', '"It also creates a backdoor for malicious actors to have a way in to be able to see your messages."', 'Dr Monica Horten, policy manager for the campaign organisation Open Rights Group, agreed: "If Apple can\'t get it right, how can the government?', '"Client-side scanning is a form of mass surveillance - it is a deep interference with privacy."', 'Prof Alan Woodward, of the University of Surrey, told BBC News that scanning could be misused: "Of course, if you say: \'Do you think children should be kept safe?\' everyone\'s going to say \'yes\'.', '"But if you then say to someone: \'Right, I\'m going to put something on your phone that\'s going to scan every single one of your images and compare it against the database,\' then suddenly you start to realise the implications."', 'Mr Cathcart said WhatsApp already detected hundreds of thousands of child sex-abuse images.', '"There are techniques that are very effective and that have not been adopted by the industry and do not require us sacrificing everyone\'s security," he said. "We report more than almost any other internet service in the world."', "But that claim has angered children's charities.
