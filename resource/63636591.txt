Along with Adele, Harry Styles has nominations for album of the year (Harry\'s House) as well as record and song of the year (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5v3kku4y6Q" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">As It Was</a>).

Both artists have long maintained, with some justification, that the Grammys sideline black artists to genre-based categories.', 'Bruno Mars and Anderson .Paak, whose side project Silk Sonic also declined to submit their album. Rather than criticise the voters, however, Mars said it "would be crazy to ask for anything more" after winning song and record of the year for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adLGHcj_fmA" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Leave The Door Open</a> at this year\'s ceremony.', 'Last month, the rapper <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-63254873" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Nicki Minaj protested</a> that her hit song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5uAR9w7LBg" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Super Freaky Girl</a> had been moved from rap to the pop categories during the shortlisting process.

At this year\'s ceremony, for example, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-60978161" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Jon Batiste won album of the year</a> for the handsome soul record We Are, beating big sellers like Olivia Rodrigo\'s Sour and Lil Nas X\'s Montero. ', 'His victory reinforced the perception that Grammy voters care more about tradition and musical chops than innovation and commercial performance - something many former nominees have grumbled about. ', 'However, that could change this year, after almost 2,000 new members joined the voting organisation, 44% of whom come "from traditionally underrepresented communities," according to the Recording Academy. "And almost 50% are under the age of 40," noted chief executive, Harvey Mason Jr.', 'The nominees were announced in a livestream from the Grammy Museum in Los Angeles by former winners including Olivia Rodrigo, Cyndi Lauper and John Legend.', "Here's a rundown of the major categories, and who might stand to win at the ceremony on 5 February, 2023.", "The headline here is the repeat of 2017's best album race, in which Adele's 25 controversially beat Beyoncé's Lemonade. ", 'On stage, Adele said: "I can\'t possibly accept this award. I\'m very humbled and very grateful and gracious but my life is Beyoncé." In the end, she held on to the trophy - but when it arrived in the mail it was broken in two. That\'s symbolism.', 'So who will take top honours this time? Beyoncé\'s Renaissance is undoubtedly the better album - a bold blast of dancefloor catharsis, which <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-61878412" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">champions the black and queer roots of house music</a>. But Grammy voters often play it safe, choosing "traditional" songcraft over innovation. ', "The academy's membership has been revamped since the upset of 2017, potentially tipping the balance in Beyoncé's favour. But Adele has won all 13 Grammys she's been nominated for since 2012.", "This is Taylor Swift's sixth song of the year nomination - meaning she now ties with Sir Paul McCartney and Lionel Richie as the category's most-nominated writer. The recognition comes for All To Well, a break-up ballad that originally appeared on her 2012 album Red, but was re-recorded with extra verses (and extra juicy details) last year.", 'However, Swift has never won best song - and her competition this year is especially tough. ', "Adele's comeback Easy On Me is the presumed frontrunner: A big blustery ballad, it sold more in the US than her previous song of the year winner, Hello, and spent 10 weeks at number one.", 'Harry Styles can beat that, though. As It Was, a pop song whose nimble melody disguises lyrics about loneliness and doubt, enjoyed 15 weeks atop the US charts earlier this year. ', 'While the song of the year award recognises music and lyrics, record of the year looks at the finished product - the actual sound recording. ', "However, there's significant crossover between the categories, with Adele, Beyoncé, Lizzo and Styles all picking up duplicate nominations.", "Once again, Adele leads the pack, but Lizzo's outrageously charismatic About Damn Time could be a contender.", "Meanwhile, Swedish pop legends Abba gained a surprise nomination for Don't Shut Me Down, taken from their comeback album Voyage. ", "The sumptuously-recorded vocals alone could be enough to earn them a Grammy award - which would be the band's first.", "Most years provide a breakout star whose victory in the best new artist category seems nailed on. Last year it was Olivia Rodrigo. This year, it's an entirely open field.", 'Predicted nominations for rapper Jack Harlow and singer-songwriter Gayle failed to materialise, despite nominations in other categories.', 'As a result, the smart money is on Atlanta rapper Latto, thanks to her breakout hit Big Energy, for which she bagged a guest appearance from music legend Mariah Carey.

', "Artists are eligible if they have broken into public consciousness over the past 12 months, even if they've received prior Grammy nominations.", 'Follow us on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BBCEntsNews/" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Facebook</a> or on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/BBCNewsEnts" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">@BBCNewsEnts</a>.
