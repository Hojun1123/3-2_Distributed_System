', 'On Chinese social media, posts complaining about conditions - such as local merchants telling people not to make reservations because they are unable to work - have been censored.  ', 'Many people worry that the de facto lockdown will last longer.', "Shanghai has been under lockdown for seven weeks - a lot longer than the city's initial plan of a week-long lockdown staggered over different parts of the city.", 'It was decided to extend a city-wide full lockdown indefinitely when cases surged to more than 13,000 a day at the beginning of April.', 'Workplaces, schools and a number of factories have now been closed for weeks.
