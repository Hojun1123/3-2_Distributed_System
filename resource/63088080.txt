"Thank you, thank you and thank you again.', '"Corny though it sounds, I quite like the way that we\'ve all helped each other get through some of our ongoing problems together - the pandemic, the financial downturns, the ups and downs of life in the UK. Sometimes it\'s been very difficult for everybody.', '"[We] tried on this programme to bring just a little bit of light relief, a good genuine atmosphere, uplifting tunes, good conversation, a little bit of satire. We tried to make the show unique and just be good company. I can only hope that we\'ve done that some of the time.', '"I\'m also really aware there are more things to think about than a radio show ending so I don\'t want to be too self indulgent. What I do want to do is celebrate the show\'s success and long run, and also mention that I\'m not retiring!"', 'When the end of his "big show" was announced in July, the 68-year-old revealed that the head of Radio 2 had told him she wanted to do "something different" in his slot.

So it\'s all good.', '"Please do listen to Scott Mills and Sara Cox when they take over afternoons. They are both brilliant broadcasters and I truly wish them well when they start."', 'Wright made his name on Radio 1 with the original incarnation of Steve Wright in the Afternoon from 1981, bringing energy, comedy and his trusty posse - and pioneering the "zoo" format on the UK airwaves.', 'He moved from afternoons to the breakfast slot from 1994 to 95 before joining Radio 2 the following year, initially on Saturday mornings before resurrecting Steve Wright in the Afternoon in 1999.', 'The format included regular features including his "factoids" - listing quirky facts - and Friday\'s final episode included a series of special factoids about Steve Wright in the Afternoon.', 'Former Radio 1 colleague Nicky Campbell earlier paid tribute to Wright on his Radio 5 Live show, describing him as a "proper genius" of radio.', '"Just to know him and to watch him work was extraordinary," Campbell said. "He\'s a conjurer, he\'s a magician, he\'s a high wire artist, and he\'s a communicator extraordinaire. He is, I\'ll say it again, a radio genius, and he will always be a radio hero."', "Other friends and famous fans lined up to bid farewell to Wright's daily show.", 'World Cup winner Jürgen Klinsmann invites you to subscribe to his daily World Cup newsletter.', '© 2022 BBC.
