", '"We hope that, if the public is increasingly aware these measures are in place, it will deter them from taking risks around roadworks and playing Russian roulette with workers\' lives," she said.', 'In the past year the firm recorded 18 "incursions" - cases of unauthorised vehicles driving into its coned-off work sites. ', 'They reported 12 of the motorists to police, several were charged including a drunk-driver and a driver who tested positive for cocaine. ', 'Two people were left seriously injured as a result of the incursions.

', 'It said 76% had seen motorists jump red lights in working areas and 13% have had objects thrown at them from moving vehicles. ', 'Duncan Crilley, operations supervisor at Bear Scotland, who is based in Corpach near Fort William, was hit by a bottle of urine while working on-site and the window of a digger was smashed when an apple was thrown at him.', '"Every day my traffic management team is phoning the police because somebody has jumped lights or tried to race through convoy setups," he said.', '"It is dangerous. The team don\'t have a safety zone around them because it is being controlled by a 10-mile-an-hour traffic limit.', '"You will always get one driver who thinks they can catch up with the convoy by breaking the speed limit and driving through the cones or barriers."', "Two years ago, one of the workers on Mr Crilley's team was hit as a result. The driver got out and proceeded to shout abuse at the road workers.", '"Drivers get abusive. They shout and swear. They throw objects at us," Mr Crilley said.', '"People need to take deep breaths. They have got to realise that there are going to be roadworks. There are going to be accidents in the road. They have no right to take their temper out on roadworkers."', 'Â© 2022 BBC.
