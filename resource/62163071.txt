Residential buildings were also hit in the centre of Vinnytsia, which has a population of around 370,000.", 'The Russian defence ministry, which denies targeting civilians, has yet to comment on the strike.

What is this, if not an open act of terrorism?" Mr Zelensky said in a statement on social media.', 'He said that Russia had ended the lives of civilians at the same time as a conference on Russian war crimes was taking place in the Netherlands.', '"Russia has thus shown its attitude to international law, to Europe, and to the entire civilised world," he said.', '"After that, no-one can have any doubt that a Special Tribunal on Russian aggression against Ukraine is needed as soon as possible."', 'Ukrainian officials said one of the three children who died in the attack was a young girl called Liza, who was returning from a speech therapy session with her mother when the rocket strike hit.', "Social media footage reposted by Ukraine's defence ministry appeared to show Liza pushing a pink pram as she walked alongside her mother earlier in the day.

The ruins of the tall Jubilee building are up ahead, all its windows blown out.", 'The House of Officers is still smouldering, smoke gusting across the square. There are dozens of firefighters at the scene working through the giant piles of wreckage in front of me. Many cars have been destroyed by fire.', 'This is a large open space in central Vinnytsia, now a disaster scene.', 'When the missiles struck this town it was the middle of the morning, a beautiful sunny day with people out and about, as they still are right now.', "They would have felt relatively safe in this town, far from the frontlines. There's been nothing like this attack here before, so when the sirens wailed many will have ignored them.", "It's hard to live life underground. Even now as I am writing this there is an air raid warning - but there are cars and people all around.", "And yet there's no such thing as safe in Ukraine anymore.
