', 'Staff say they are providing as many face-to-face appointments as possible, but say patients have been frustrated and some even abusive.', 'So how are they managing to cope?', 'Amanda Gunn, a receptionist at Danbury Medical Centre in Chelmsford, says she has "really noticed a change, it has got a lot busier now".', 'She says the surgery is seeing "a lot of issues which could be dealt with at the pharmacy".', '"We have to work really hard to get to the people who really need our help," she says.', 'The 50-year-old says the reception staff receive "quite a lot" of abuse.', '"It got so bad about a month ago they were talking about bodycams for us to wear," she says.', '"The patients are frustrated. I can understand that - sometimes when you\'ve got to ring up and you\'ve got to wait on the phone.', '"Patients come in and they\'re angry and they think if they really beat you down you\'ll give them an appointment, but there aren\'t the appointments to give them. The doctors are back-to-back with patients."', 'Michelle Manning, the reception manager at the surgery, says: "The appointments go so quickly it\'s hard for us to turn around to the patients and say all the appointments have gone - and that\'s while we\'ve got more patients ringing in."', 'She believes there have been more people contacting the surgery during the pandemic.
