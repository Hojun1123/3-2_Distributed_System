', '"If you have an appointment to go to the doctor or the hospital or the dentist, you can\'t rely on the neighbours every time," she said. ', '"We\'re lost without the buses... the clocks are turning and it\'s getting dark, it isn\'t a good place to walk," Ms Lowe added. ', '"They\'ve just stopped it. We miss it terribly." ', 'Margaret Atkinson, who lives in a nearby cottage park for the elderly, said the walk to the nearest bus stop was also dangerous, with barely enough room for two cars to pass each other.', '"If there was a pedestrian on the road they would have no chance at all... there\'s no street light, there\'s no pavement, it\'s so dangerous."', 'Karen Simcox, 63, a chef at Plas Penmon care home, said she now has to walk more than a mile through dark lanes every morning just to get to work.
