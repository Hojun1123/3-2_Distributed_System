['<b class="ssrcss-hmf8ql-BoldText e5tfeyi3">The US envoy on climate change John Kerry has warned that the war in Ukraine must not be used as an excuse to prolong global reliance on coal. </b>', 'Speaking to the BBC, Mr Kerry criticised a number of large countries for not living up to the promises they made at the COP26 climate summit.', 'Climate diplomats meet again today in Bonn amid new, energy security worries.', 'If countries extend their reliance on coal in response to the war, then "we are cooked," Mr Kerry said. ', "The fragile unity shown in Glasgow last November is likely to be tested in Bonn as countries deal with the fallout from Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the cost of living crisis.", 'Mr Kerry told the BBC that despite these drawbacks, "as a world we are still not moving fast enough," to rein in the emissions of warming gases that are driving up temperatures. ', '"We can still win this battle,"  the former senator said, but it will require a "wholesale elevation of effort by countries all around the world".', "Mr Kerry's call was echoed by a leading Ukrainian scientist who urged delegates to speed up their transition away from fossil fuels. ", 'Dr Svitana Krakovska said oil and gas were the "enablers of war".', 'Today\'s <a href="https://unfccc.int/SB56" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">meeting in Bonn</a>, which will last until the end of next week, is much smaller than COP26 and is mainly a technical negotiation.', 'It occurs halfway between the big conferences in Glasgow and <a href="https://cop27.eg/" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">COP27</a>, to be held in Egypt.', 'The talks will be carried out by civil servants with limited political input and will review progress on a host of issues agreed in the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-56901261" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Glasgow Climate Pact</a>,', 'Bluntly, not a lot.

', 'The world emerged from Glasgow into an energy crisis sparked by a rapid rise in the price of gas. This has been massively compounded by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and ongoing problems in global supply lines. ', 'Prices for fossil energy have shot up dramatically as governments worry about security of supply. ', 'Governments have also been slow in submitting new carbon cutting plans as they have promised to do by September.  The list of laggards includes some very significant countries such as India, and the hosts of COP27, Egypt.', 'Despite this, there is a belief that political leaders still see climate as a major issue, especially in the light of <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-61484697" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">dramatic heatwaves in India and Pakistan</a>, which were linked to human use of fossil fuels.  ', "The discussions in the former West German capital will tell us if that's true.", '"I think we\'ll see the Bonn talks as a real test for whether political will is just words," said Alex Scott from environmental think tank, E3G. ', '"Or whether there are real genuine commitments to make the changes in policy and in spending plans that are needed to address these issues."', 'Ukraine and Russia normally send delegates to this event, but it remains to be seen if both countries will participate. ', 'This video can not be played', '"Think about us," says Ukrainian climate scientist', "Dr Svitlana Krakovska, who led the Ukrainian delegation at the approval sessions of the recent IPCC reports, says climate isn't a critical issue right now. ", 'But she hopes negotiators will recognise the role fossil fuels are playing in the war, and act with greater haste to transition away from them.', '"The cause of this war, the enabler of this war is from oil and gas," she told BBC News.', '"So this is the point for everybody to just think about this and use this opportunity to stop using so much energy and think about our way of life."', '"The global thing that has happened are these unprecedentedly high fossil fuel prices," said Lauri Myllyvirta from the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air. ', '"That just means that clean energy is extremely competitive economically at the moment."', 'Some countries have indeed been increasing their coal production, such as India, where the government has decided to re-open more than 100 coal mines previously considered uneconomical.

It's continued because of the resurgence of Covid-19 and the re-introduction of lockdowns which have stemmed economic activity.
