', 'Tankers worked through the night to pump waste out of the nearby Haydon End Sewer Pumping Station.', 'A Thames Water spokeswoman said this would reduce the flow of sewage into the waterways. ', 'The sewer is due to be repaired later this week and aeration devices have been installed in both the brook and the river to mitigate the impact of the burst on wildlife.  ', 'The site of the burst sewer is close to the location of two similar incidents - one in April 2021 and another in August this year. ', 'The cause of the latest burst is unknown.', 'The Thames Water spokeswoman said: "We are monitoring the river\'s water quality closely, and are taking steps to help the river recover, including increasing oxygen levels in the river to protect wildlife.

', 'Thames Water said there was high demand for tankers due to recent heavy rain across the country, but said it was being supported by teams from Severn Trent Water.
