His voter approval rating has plummeted in the past months, as news emerged of his party's connections to the church.", 'An internal investigation by the Liberal Democratic Party - of which Mr Kishida is head - found 179 of its 379 lawmakers had interacted with the Unification Church.', "Following that report, Mr Kishida apologised and said he had asked his party's lawmakers to cut all ties with the sect.

Lawyers have accused it of coercing devotees - known colloquially as "Moonies" after its founder - to donate large sums of money.', "Mr Abe's relationship to the religious group had been the topic of speculation before his death, especially on social media. He had appeared remotely as a speaker at a church-related event last year, and his grandfather - also a former Japan PM, was believed to have been close to it due to its anti-communist nature.", 'Â© 2022 BBC.
