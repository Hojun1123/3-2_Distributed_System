', '"People are now going without water, they are being rationed to two or three buckets of water a day," Tuvalu\'s minister for finance Seve Paeniu told BBC News. ', 'Rich countries have resisted this discussion over financing for 30 years, fearing that since they historically played a major role in causing climate change, they will have to pay for it for centuries to come.', 'But the impacts of flooding in Pakistan, Nigeria and elsewhere in recent years have tipped the balance - here in Egypt the issue of the losses and damages due to rising temperatures finally made it onto the negotiating agenda. ', 'The final discussions at COP26 in Glasgow last year almost fell apart on the issue of coal.', 'Richer countries wanted to phase out the use of the most polluting fossil fuel.', 'Larger developing economies including India and China did not.

Traditionally, the developed nations paid and the larger emerging economies, such as India, China and Brazil did not. ', 'Now the US and EU want to expand the number of countries that contribute - and China is top of their list. ', '"By the end of this decade, China could overtake the US in terms of its historical cumulative emissions, and is the world\'s second largest economy, and yet in UN terms it still counts as a developing country," said Bernice Lee, from Chatham House. ', '"But the US has consistently failed to deliver climate finance and shoulder its responsibility as the world\'s largest emitter to support the the developing world.
