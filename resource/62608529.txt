', 'Russia denies the accusations, and says its troops are protecting the plant.', '"Of course I\'m concerned," Mr Guterres said. ', '"When you have military activity, bombardments close to a nuclear power plant, this is a matter of concern for everybody.', '"I hope that it\'ll be possible to start engaging in a way that will, at least for the moment, end all military operations."', 'Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky has repeatedly accused Russia of "nuclear blackmail", and some officials claim Russia has fabricated a crisis to force Ukraine and other countries to comply with their conditions, as the nearly six-month old war seems to be at a deadlock.', 'The claims cannot be independently verified, as the site has been under Russian occupation since early March. ', 'Ukrainian technicians still operate it, however, and some say they are being kept at gunpoint.
