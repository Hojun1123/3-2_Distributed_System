"Of course there\'s some legitimate debate about how your get there, quite rightly as well, particularly in a cost of living squeeze.', '"But I think it\'s undeniable - and a day like today rather proves the point, doesn\'t it - that if you don\'t tackle these things then the economic and social cost is going to be even greater still. So we have to do it."', "Mr Shapps's sentiments were echoed by the prime minister during the final scheduled cabinet meeting of his premiership on Tuesday.", 'As much of the UK sweltered in the heatwave, Mr Johnson told ministers: "Who can doubt that we were right to be the first major economy to go for net zero?', '"It may be sometimes unfashionable to say this but it is the right thing to do."', "The legal commitment to net zero was first made by former Prime Minister Theresa May's government and taken forward by Mr Johnson since his election in 2019.", 'At the COP26 climate conference in Scotland last year, Mr Johnson attempted to rally the international community behind efforts to curb carbon emissions.', "But since then skyrocketing inflation and the contest to elect Mr Johnson's replacement have tested the consensus on reaching net zero within the party.", 'In a pointed intervention, cabinet minister and COP26 President Alok Sharma told the Observer newspaper he might resign if the next prime minister failed to commit to net zero.', 'Mr Sharma then chaired a packed-out hustings, where all the candidates confirmed their commitment to the climate target.', 'The Conservative Environment Network (CEN), which organised the hustings, said it was now clear the "candidates largely understand the strength of public and parliamentary support for environmental action and the strong economic and security case for achieving net zero".', '"Despite the hopes of a few siren voices, the Conservative leadership race is focused on how - not if - to decarbonise the UK\'s economy and restore nature," Sam Hall, the director of the CEN, told the BBC.', 'Chris Skidmore, former energy minister and chairman of the Net Zero Support Group of Conservative MPs, said he was "delighted" all candidates had now signed up to the pledge.', 'He said: "Since the beginning of the Conservative leadership contest, there has been a question mark over the future of net zero and our climate commitments, especially with a few candidates speaking against the idea of a target to deliver emissions reductions.', '"The reality is that this is an internationally agreed framework that the UK has led, demonstrating that you can halve your carbon dioxide emissions at the same time as doubling the size of the economy.', '"As the energy and climate minister who signed net zero into law three years ago, I know how seriously other countries are watching the UK\'s progress to decarbonise. We are seen as international leaders."', 'Meanwhile questions remain over how the UK intends to reach net zero by 2050.', 'On Monday, a court ordered the government to explain exactly how its policies will achieve the target, after a legal challenge from environmental groups.', 'One of the groups, Friends of the Earth (FotE), described the decision as a "landmark ruling" and "a huge victory for climate justice and government transparency".', 'World Cup winner Jürgen Klinsmann invites you to subscribe to his daily World Cup newsletter.', '© 2022 BBC.
