Then, half the banking system went bust. ', "Now, mainly tiny companies, many of which aren't even well known to subscribers of Utility Week, are going bust after some adventurous forays into the energy markets. The number of customers is about one million.", 'While security of their domestic supply must be maintained, this should not be an existential, systemic crisis, except some of the big boys in the industry are talking this up in those terms.
