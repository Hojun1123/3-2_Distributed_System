She studied history and went on to become a teacher, rising to the position of headmistress at a school in Edakkara town.', "In 1938, inspired by Mahatma Gandhi, she gave up her job to join the Travancore State Congress (state unit of Gandhi's Indian National Congress) and fight for India's independence. ", '"Shakespeare has said that the world is a stage and that all the men and women are merely players; but to me, this life is a long protest," Cherian wrote in the introduction to her autobiography, Jeevitham: Oru Samaram (Life: A Struggle). "Protest against conservatism, meaningless rituals, societal injustice, gender discrimination against anything that is dishonest, unjust," she wrote.', '"When I see anything like this, I turn blind, I even forget who I am fighting."', 'Cherian was just 29 and a few months into joining the freedom movement when the Travancore State Congress was declared illegal by the British government in India.

The protest continued until the government agreed to release the prisoners.', 'India\'s independence leader Mahatma Gandhi heard of the incident later and dubbed her "Jhansi Ki Rani (Queen) of Travancore".

", 'In the following years, Cherian was arrested several times for violating prohibitory orders and participating in protests.', 'In 1942, she became the acting president of the state congress. One of her first acts was to welcome the Quit India resolution passed by Indian National Congress at a session in Bombay (now Mumbai).', 'The resolution called for complete independence from British rule and marked the beginning of a large-scale non-violent struggle across the country.', 'Post-independence, Cherian attempted to chart a path in active politics. In 1947, she was elected as a lawmaker in the first free election held in the state of Travancore. ', 'In the 1950s, however, she quit the Congress party after she was denied a ticket to parliamentary elections in India.', 'The then-president of the state congress committee said women in Travancore were already "empresses of the home" and that politics was not their space.', 'In her autobiography, Cherian noted that women like her who had been at the forefront of the freedom struggle were later side-lined in the party and looked over for important roles in independent India.', 'Cherian went on to marry a fellow freedom fighter and party worker, VV Varkey Mannamplackal.', '"When I used to visit them, they lived in a small house which had more books than furniture. I remember her grace and Varkey\'s soft-spoken scholarship. It was evident why they had to quit politics," <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070210202013/http://www.tehelka.com/story_main25.asp?filename=op012007culture_vulture.asp" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">writer Paul Zacharia wrote in 2007</a>.', 'Historian J Devika has called Cherian one of the first-generation feminists of the state.', 'The freedom fighter died in 1982 in the state capital, Thiruvananthapuram (formerly Trivandrum).
