", 'The union said every service in Scotland had supported industrial action, and called on ministers to return to the negotiating table.', 'The government said there was no more money for public sector pay rises and that a strike would be "catastrophic".', 'Action is expected to start by the end of the year after RCN members across the UK voted to strike.', 'The most recent Scottish government pay offer was for a flat rate of £2,205 per person, backdated to April.', 'The union has described the deal as a real-terms pay cut and accused the government of not listening to staff concerns. It asked for at least 5% above inflation, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-12196322" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">which rose to 10.1% in September</a>.', "The RCN's Scotland director, Colin Poolman, said turnout had reached 70% in some of the organisations which had been balloted, and that more than 90% of members had voting in favour of strike action in most areas.", 'He said "life-preserving services" would still be in place despite the industrial action.', 'Mr Poolman said he hoped the Scottish government would return to negotiations with an improved offer.', '"If we don\'t do something now, the nursing crisis is only going to get worse and have a direct impact on patient care," he said.', '"This is not just about nursing pay, this is about supporting patients and ensuring that we have a sustainable workforce going forward."', 'Last month, members staged a protest outside the Scottish Parliament after the union confirmed it was balloting all 300,000 UK members for the first time in its 106-year history.', 'Last week about 2,500 workers in the Unite union voted for industrial action.', 'Members of the GMB union and the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy have <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-63476882" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">also backed strike action</a>.', 'But Unison, Scotland\'s largest health union, has <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-63406877" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">suspended its strike ballot of NHS staff</a> and is consulting its members on a revised pay offer until 14 November.', 'When you talk to nurses who have been juggling shifts for 20 years or who moved out of their homes during the pandemic, there is a real sense of exhaustion and low morale.', 'Again and again staff talk about earning more in a supermarket or an office where there are more regular hours and less demands. ', "It's perhaps no surprise then that there has been such support for strike action in every part of Scotland, with the RCN saying the future of the profession is at risk without better rewards.", "Other unions that represent staff like paramedics, midwives or physiotherapists also stand ready to strike. However, the biggest healthcare union, Unison - which represents domestic staff through to senior nurses - has pulled its strike ballot, preferring to let members decide whether to accept the government's pay offer. ", 'There is still time for negotiations to continue, but in the meantime discussions will take place between unions and health boards to work out which services are critical to patient safety.', 'It means some staff who may have voted in favour of industrial action but who work in A&amp;E or intensive care will still be asked to cover shifts.', 'The latest pay offer in Scotland would mean an average salary increase of 7%, with the lowest paid gaining more than 11% and qualified nursing staff receiving up to 8.45%.
