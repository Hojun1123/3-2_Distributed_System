National Express had already had its eye on continued overseas expansion, with its US school bus operation proving resilient, and new bus services being rolled out in Morocco."', 'The new potential group is likely to be hungry to find more similar opportunities in the rest of the world, she added.', 'National Express did acknowledge that the merger would see one-off costs of up to £40m in the first two years after the deal, if it was approved.', 'The firm, which also runs rail operations in Germany, said that the all-share tie-up would, however, allow the new group to save "at least" £35m annually, with about 25% by the end of the first year.', 'Both companies stressed that the talks were still ongoing and that "there can be no certainty that an offer will be made".', 'National Express has until 19 October to make a firm offer.
