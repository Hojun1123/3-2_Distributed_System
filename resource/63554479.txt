', 'The Conservatives would hope to do well from increased representation in South East England, while Labour could lose out if there are fewer seats in the northern areas of England, and Plaid Cymru are particularly unhappy about <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-55311193" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">the drop in seats in Wales</a>.', 'However, the changes have been drawn up entirely based on population changes and the calculation detailed above, and finalised by independent commissioners.', 'One of the disappearing seats is coming from Glasgow and the surrounding area, while the other is coming from the north of the country, between Aberdeenshire and the Highlands.', 'The old Moray constituency is to be cut in two, with Elgin joining a new Nairn, Strathspey and Moray West seat which spreads south down the A9 to Dalwhinnie.', 'On the other side, Keith and Buckie would move over into Aberdeenshire North and Moray East - a very coastal grouping which includes Peterhead and Fraserburgh.', 'The inland parts of the old Banff and Buchan constituency are to join up with the old Gordon one to create Aberdeenshire Central.', 'Meanwhile, the current Glasgow Central constituency will essentially be broken up and parcelled off into the city constituencies around it.', 'Inverclyde is to inherit the western chunk of Renfrewshire, while the old East Dunbartonshire seat would expand north to become Bearsden and Campsie Fells.', 'On the other side of the city, a new Motherwell and Clydesdale North seat is to spread out to the east, while Lanark will be split off to join Hamilton in a new constituency called Hamilton and Clyde Valley.', 'Orkney and Shetland and Na h-Eileanan an Iar are protected in law, and a handful of other seats are being retained in their present shape or only having a change of name.', 'But, otherwise, there are big changes right across the country - even beyond where seats have "disappeared".', 'A fresh attempt has been made at carving up the sparsely-populated Highlands into manageable chunks, with Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross expanding to take in Dingwall.', 'The old Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey seat is being split between the new Nairn, Strathspey and Moray West constituency mentioned earlier, and a new Inverness-shire and Wester Ross seat which covers much - but not all - of the old Ross, Skye and Lochaber.', 'The southernmost chunk of that old seat is off to join Arygll, Bute and South Lochaber.

Or buy a boat.', 'A big chunk of Angus is to join a new Dundee East and Arbroath seat - which essentially starts from Broughty Ferry - while the bulk of the city remains in Dundee West.', 'Further down the Tay, there is to be a new seat of Perth and Loch Leven. It takes in a big chunk of the old Ochil and South Perthshire seat, although Dollar has been split off to join Dunfermline and East Ochils and Auchterarder is part of a new Clackmannanshire and Forth Valley seat.', 'Meanwhile in the capital, East Edinburgh will expand to capture Musselburgh from East Lothian, while losing some of its western fringe to Edinburgh South.', 'The last attempt at a boundary review actually would have seen Scotland lose six seats, as part of a move to cut 50 seats from the Commons.', 'It didn\'t happen in the end, because that whole review <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-52036168" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">was scrapped by then-prime minister Theresa May</a>.', 'The current set of proposals is due to be submitted to the Speaker of the House of Commons for approval in July 2023.', 'It is not clear what would happen if there was an early general election or a change of government in the interim, because election returning officers are going to need some time to get to grips with the new set-up.', "For now it's down to the public to have a final say on the proposals, to see if any changes are made before the last consultation closes.", 'Â© 2022 BBC.
