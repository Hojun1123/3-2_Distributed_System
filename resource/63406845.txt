', 'However, the CQC also found staff were "proud to work for the organisation" and all staff had personal and organisational commitment to provide high-quality services.', '"Whilst leaders understood the importance of staff being able to raise concerns without fear of retribution, the culture did not always encourage openness and honesty at all levels and learning or action was not always taken as a result of concerns raised," the report said.', 'The inspectors identified areas where governance processes needed to be strengthened and said action is needed to fully embed a culture where all staff feel respected, valued and supported.', 'Deanna Westwood, CQC\'s director of operations - South Network, said: "We heard concerns from staff about the organisational culture - particularly in relation to diversity and inclusion and the experience of staff from a black and minority ethnic background.', '"We have made clear that these issues must be addressed."', 'Inspectors looked at a range of performance data, quality audits, board papers, internal and externally commissioned reports and records of handling complaints.
