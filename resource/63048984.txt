', '"It\'s going to become more common - it\'s really important that people can have confidence in the administration of their information rights," he said.', '"That\'s why we are publicly notifying these organisations that they have to bring themselves into compliance. ', '"Being able to ask an organisation \'what information do you hold on me\' and \'how it is being used\' provides transparency and accountability.', '"These are fundamental rights - these are not optional." ', 'The seven organisations were identified following a series of complaints related to their failure to respond within set timeframes, or failing to respond at all, as well as information being withheld, in breach of the UKGDPR and Data Protection Act.', 'Some of the complaints included requesting access to adoption papers where the person was told "no one seems to know where these are".', 'The person, who was anonymous, said: "I am upset and angry and just want my files."

However, we can do nothing without those transcripts. ', '"I have chased this matter for seven months and have received nothing. My client\'s child is constantly at risk so long as he stays in the home country."', 'And one example given was about access to files for someone who spent many years in care.', '"The original paper file was destroyed previously so I cannot access any of my personal data relating to my childhood," the complainant said.', '"The file contained sensitive details of trauma I suffered, and I feel now this emotional abuse cannot be answered for."', 'The ICO said it took regulatory action over infringements across 2020 and 2021 including:', 'The organisations have between three and six months to make improvements or further enforcement action could be taken.', 'A Government spokesperson said: "We take our obligations under the Data Protection Act 2018 and UK General Data Protection Regulation very seriously, and we are working hard to remove delays to Subject Access requests identified by the Information Commissioner\'s Office. ', 'A spokesperson for the MOD added: "Action is being taken to remove those delays through a significant increase in resources, but in the meantime urgent applications are being prioritised."', 'Meanwhile, a Virgin Media spokesperson told the BBC: "We apologise that our handling of subject access requests last year was not to the standard it should have been. We have since put measures in place which have significantly improved our performance and will continue to carefully monitor this."', 'A Croydon Council spokesperson said: "We apologise for any delays in our handling of Freedom of Information or Subject Access Requests and fully take on board the comments and feedback from the ICO.

The recommendations that they have provided are in line with our existing action plans and we will review their advice carefully to identify where we might take additional steps to make sure we are achieving the level of performance that our residents rightly expect."', '<i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2"><b class="ssrcss-hmf8ql-BoldText e5tfeyi3">Follow Shiona McCallum </b></i><a href="https://twitter.com/shionamc" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">on Twitter @shionamc</a>', 'World Cup winner Jürgen Klinsmann invites you to subscribe to his daily World Cup newsletter.', '© 2022 BBC.
