', 'Councillor Rachael Hunt, cabinet member for communities and local place said a collection every four weeks was "not the intention at the moment".', '"As we progress towards that idea of zero waste to landfill and a circular economy ... it\'s really important that we keep that option in, but it is not where we are progressing at the moment," she added.', 'Keirsten Wilson, project manager at the council, said: "At the moment the intention is to stay with the current regime and timescale of black bin collections.', '"The rationale for leaving it on the table for consideration in the future, and that could be quite far in the future, is the direction of travel of central government and the targets that are being set.
