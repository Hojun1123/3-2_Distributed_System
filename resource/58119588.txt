In April, the airline posted a £659m loss for 2020 after passenger numbers dropped 80%, and it has announced thousands of job cuts.", 'Selling a stake in the airline would raise much-needed funds as global aviation rebuilds.

Earlier this year, chief executive Shai Weiss said he did not expect to see a big drop in fares as travel resumes.', "A flotation would mark the first time Virgin Atlantic shares have been sold to the public, and would likely see Virgin Group's stake fall below 50%. ", 'Sir Richard founded Virgin Atlantic in 1984, and its success enabled him to build a business empire that now includes the Virgin Galactic space travel arm.', 'But the airline\'s survival appeared in doubt last year, with administrators put on standby while Sir Richard negotiated <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-53406604" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">a £1.2bn rescue package</a>.', 'That package included a loan from the American hedge fund Davidson Kempner Capital Management.
