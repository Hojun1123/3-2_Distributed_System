', 'They said "credible reporting" by Reuters and recent articles in other news outlets "directly contradicts the sworn testimony and representations of Amazon\'s top executives - including former CEO Jeffrey Bezos".', '"At best, this reporting confirms that Amazon\'s representatives misled the Committee. At worst, it demonstrates that they may have lied to Congress in possible violation of federal criminal law," the letter states.
