I went through a lot of anxiety and depression," he said, and began to be chased by debt collection agencies.', '"They don\'t give any leeway or ease with it at all," he says. "They call up quite a bit [and email]. It does make me stressed when I\'m being constantly called and badgered about it."', '"I think [Buy Now Pay Later] is quite dangerous, to be honest," Jordan says. "Especially on the advertising. They make it out to be such a good thing... but that\'s only condoning debt."', 'Jordan has recently moved to Bristol to start a new job, and will be in a position to pay off the debt.', 'Laybuy said: "Laybuy only refers a customer to a debt collector as a last resort, and only after other attempts to collect the outstanding payment have been exhausted.', '"When a debt is referred to a debt collector, we only ever refer outstanding purchase price of the product.', '"Late fees, which are limited to a maximum of £24 for a single order, are never passed to a debt collector.

', "Buy Now Pay Later arrangements aren't viewed as a normal loan by credit reference agencies and other lenders.

They don\'t realise there are going to be consequences if they don\'t pay - it gives them a false sense of security.', '"I\'ve seen people using it for their kids\' clothes and shoes that they would otherwise never be able to afford. They are taking out what is effectively a loan, but they don\'t see it as one.', '"For example, I helped someone who has tens of thousands of pounds of debt, but they don\'t see buy now pay later as part of that total.', '"It\'s almost under-the-radar debt."', 'Dame Clare Moriarty, chief executive of Citizens Advice, agrees: "A seamless buy now pay later checkout process should not mean shoppers have to dig around in the small print to find out they\'re taking out a credit agreement, and could be referred to debt collectors if they can\'t pay. The warnings should be unmissable."', 'Citizens Advice is urging anyone who has been contacted by debt collectors to get free, independent debt advice.', 'A Treasury spokesperson said: "Buy Now Pay Later can be a helpful way to manage your finances but it\'s important that consumers are protected as these agreements become more popular.', '"By stepping in and regulating, we\'re making sure people are treated fairly and only offered agreements they can afford."', 'On 2 February, the government announced it would to bring unregulated interest-free Buy Now Pay Later products into regulation.
