', 'A lot has happened at the 53-hectare Ettrick Marshes since the previous sightings in 1979 and 1980, with a rewilding project being completed in 2000 and, since ownership was taken over last year by Ettrick and Yarrow Community Development Company, boardwalks, pathways and bird-hides have been restored.', 'It is thought that the prevalence of willow across much of the wetlands is responsible for attracting and maintaining the population of <i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">Apotomis Infida.</i>', "This year's rediscovery by Dr Lindsay has led to plans for further research into numbers of the moth at the Ettrick Marshes, as well as determining its life cycle.", 'He added: "We want to try and understand the life cycle of this tiny moth, which will be tricky as we need to identify it as a caterpillar and that hasn\'t been done before."', 'Butterfly Conservation described the rediscovery after an absence of 42 years as "very exciting news".', '"It has only ever been seen in the UK at two locations - Loch Rannoch in 1919, hence its common name the Rannoch Marble, and at Ettrick Marshes in 1979 and 1980," said a spokesman.', '"So knowing it is still present is wonderful.', '"On the continent the caterpillars feed on willow, and there are several areas of willow at Ettrick, suggesting it might be breeding at the site - so the next challenge is to find the caterpillars."', 'Â© 2022 BBC.
