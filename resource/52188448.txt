", 'Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said the government has not made a decision to hike fuel duty.', 'He said that "is not government policy" and that the Treasury would "make a decision on that at the next Budget in the spring".', 'Speaking after the fuel duty rise was included in the OBR\'s review of the government\'s Autumn Statement, he said: "That was just an assumption that the OBR made."', 'So, it is still possible the duty could be frozen or go up by a different amount.', 'In theory, fuel duty should go up every year.', "However, in March, Rishi Sunak - who was chancellor at the time - used the government's Spring Statement to cut the tax, following concerns about rising prices.", 'Fuel duty on petrol and diesel was reduced by 5p, from 58p to 53p, for 12 months.', "The OBR's statement assumes that 5p cut will end as planned in March.", 'It has also factored in a scheduled rise of 7p on top of that.', 'However, chancellors do not always go ahead with increases to fuel duty.', 'Before Mr Sunak reduced it, the tax had been frozen since 2011.', "Fuel duty goes into the government's general spending pot.", "And it's a big money-spinner, tending to raise about £28bn a year.", 'The Treasury said the 5p cut introduced in March would cost the public purse £2.4bn in 2022/23.', 'For 2022-23, the OBR expects fuel duties to raise £26.2bn in total.', "There's also a question mark over how the government will make up the shortfall in the tax as more people start to drive electric cars.", 'However, the Treasury will also start charging vehicle excise duty on them from 2025.', 'Petrol and diesel prices have been on a rollercoaster ride this year.', 'Recent data puts petrol at an average of 164p per litre on UK forecourts.

A weaker pound means fuel gets more expensive.', "Prices were rising before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but the fallout made fuel more expensive.", "Russia used to be one of the world's largest oil exporters, but that was before punishing sanctions were imposed by the West.", 'The US has banned all imports of Russian oil.
