Do they offer some protection in old age or are they simply a reflection of better brain health?', 'The key aim of the <a href="https://www.brain.northwestern.edu/superaging/index.html" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">SuperAging Research Program</a> at Northwestern University in Illinois - which has been running for more than a decade - is to find out what keeps the brain cognitively sharp and protects people from dementia.

', 'They found the super-agers had bigger, healthier neurons in this brain region than the others.', "They also appear to be less prone to accumulating abnormal deposits of protein, known as tangles, typically seen in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's. ", "Dr Rosa Sancho, from Alzheimer's Research UK, believes projects such as the SuperAging Program might help towards finding and developing new treatments for dementia.", '"Further research will need to uncover exactly what causes these super-ager brain cells to be larger and better protected," said Dr Sancho. ', '"For example, is it a genetic feature super-agers are born with, and if so what features?"', 'She added: "While researchers work to understand how to stop changes in the brain that cause dementia, there are small steps we can all take to keep our brains healthy as we age."', "The exact cause of Alzheimer's disease is not yet fully understood, but a number of things are thought to increase the risk.", 'While some, such as age and genetics, are unavoidable, lifestyle factors such as abstaining from smoking, eating a healthier diet and exercising, can lower the risk.', 'Lead researcher at Northwestern, Prof Tamar Gefen, told the BBC that they planned to build a detailed picture of the super-agers to understand more: "We need to study their genetics, lifestyle factors and educational attainment. We also need to capture their history and personal narratives. I have been fortunate to know these inspiring people intimately in both life and in death."', 'Â© 2022 BBC.
