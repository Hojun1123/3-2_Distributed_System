Structural changes, cultural changes and organisational changes because we cannot retain the status quo."', 'In response to the chief minister\'s statement, Claire Christian MHK said the current administration would be "defined by the results of the action taken to drive bad culture out from within the ranks of our civil service and politics".', '"We need to shake this tree once and for all for bad apples and show the people of the Isle of Man that this government knows the true meaning of integrity," she added.', 'Tim Glover MHK said it was important to emphasise that "most civil servants are very conscientious and hard-working and very diligent", but raised concerns that the Council of Ministers was "going into this not unblemished themselves".', 'He said: "There used to be a culture of politicians doing the right thing and stepping down when they became the story.', '"Surely for this review to have more chance of success you need a clean sheet?"', 'Welcoming the reviews, Tim Johnson MHK said the chief minister had "the opportunity to do something fundamental" by putting in place "the culture, mechanisms and policies to ensure individuals across the public sector have the confidence to speak out safely about all questionable practice and procedure".', 'Calling for retrospective exit interviews for staff who have left the public sector, Michelle Haywood MHK added that whistleblowing was "often a courageous last resort for those who have no other recourse to any other actions, and their convictions drive them down a route that will ultimately end their career".', '<i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">Why not follow BBC Isle of Man on </i><a href="https://en-gb.facebook.com/bbcisleofman/" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Facebook</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2"> and </i><a href="https://twitter.com/BBCIsleofMan" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Twitter</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">?
