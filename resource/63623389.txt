', '"I was suffering with my mental health and I was looking for somewhere to turn to," she said. ', '"I saw about the centre on Facebook and a few people had said to me that it was brilliant, so I registered and I am so glad I did."', "Kate's first interactions with the centre were done virtually due to restrictions.", '"I joined the Ma\'s project. It gave me time to talk with other mothers about topics or engage in activities or simply socialise. ', '"It started off on Zoom but it was good to see the girls and we just couldn\'t wait to get into the building."', 'For many years, Kate felt that she needed support but felt ashamed to ask for it.

', '"We have created an atmosphere and culture of empowerment, where women can come in with a lot of stresses and just relax. ', '"We have the park for the children as well as our community orchard and gardens, we even have won a Green Flag for our site, which is a big thing for this area that the tourist industry is sending people to Poleglass.', '"Children in Need has been core to supporting our service over the last few years, empowering women and families in this area which has high levels of poverty."', 'The centre has also created employment through their day-care service, with 17 posts. ', '"Our day-care is there for working parents, those that need respite and we also support social services."', 'A partnership between Children in Need and Money Heroes has also been teaching children at Footprints about the importance of budgeting. Young children at the centre are given money in envelopes of differing amounts.
