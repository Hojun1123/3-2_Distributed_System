', 'The plan had been to vent excess gas at an offshore hub to reduce the corrosive CO2 content in the pipes.', 'Natural gas is methane, a powerful greenhouse gas.', 'The UK was one of 100 countries that pledged to cut methane gas emissions by 30% over the next 10 years. ', 'Under the new plan Shell will bring a higher percentage of gas ashore.', 'It was the Cambo oil field, west of Shetland, that got the attention as world leaders gathered in Glasgow seven months ago to show their commitment to tackling climate change.', 'Cambo was the test of how serious the UK government really was. As minority partner in the development, Shell pulled out. It was expensive, in deep water, and the politics of it made it a riskier investment.', 'It had other projects to consider first. Jackdaw, a gas field close to existing infrastructure, was what Shell describes as a "vanilla" project - relatively, very straight forward. ', 'Permission to install a tie-back (subsea link) to a nearby platform had been refused last year, on the grounds that production would raise emissions unacceptably.', 'Shell appealed. It wants to capture those emissions at the carbon capture and storage plant it is helping to plan for St Fergus in Aberdeenshire (but which the UK government put on the back burner). And it plans also to re-power its offshore platforms with renewable electricity rather than burning gas.', "Along with the sudden rise in concern about energy security that followed Russia's invasion of Ukraine, those arguments appear to have won over the UK government and its regulator.", "The fight doesn't stop here. The industry saw Jackdaw as a test of whether the UK government is serious about energy security: but for environmental campaigners, it's a test of whether the UK government is serious about climate change.", '© 2022 BBC.
