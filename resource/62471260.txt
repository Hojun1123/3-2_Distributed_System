', 'Dame Sharon, who is a former Treasury civil servant, said she was cautious about giving advice to her former colleagues, but said "one area" that had not had "enough attention" was the job market over the past 18 months.', '"Regardless of what has happened coming out of Covid, if the labour market is that tight, if we continue to have far fewer people in work [or] looking for work -  you\'ve inevitably got more inflation and more wage inflation," she said.', '"I guess I would encourage...any government to really think much more about how to encourage more people back into work.', '"There\'s not a business in the UK that\'s not finding it very difficult to recruit at the moment because there are so many more jobs and far fewer people looking for work.
