', "Cambo became the focus of environmental protests at the UN's COP26 climate change conference in Glasgow last year.", 'Ithaca CEO Alan Bruce said he believed the project would pass a "climate compatibility checkpoint" which the UK government is planning to introduce, although the test would not cover already-licenced areas like Cambo.', 'He told BBC Scotland: "It feels like we\'re in a better position to consider all of the projects a bit more holistically. ', '"A lot\'s happened since last year of course and, in my mind, I feel like the debate has matured a little bit in terms of people having maybe a broader understanding of all of the dimensions that are important from an energy security perspective. ', '"So, I would say now we\'re having a more rounded debate about all of the projects that exist."', 'The Cambo field, which Ithaca will acquire with the purchase of its owner Siccar Point, is thought to contain about 170 million barrels of recoverable oil.
