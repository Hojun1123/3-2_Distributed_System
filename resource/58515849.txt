And it\'s got a beautiful flow to it," she said.', 'This year\'s London Fashion Week, which has just finished, has made "circularity" its buzzword. This concept is all about "designing out" waste, ensuring clothing can be remade again and again.', "The week's schedule featured a screening of Fashionscapes: A Circular Economy - a documentary exploring whether the increased industry pledges around sustainability are anywhere close to being attainable.", 'At present, the fashion industry accounts for <a href="https://www.unece.org/info/media/presscurrent-press-h/forestry-and-timber/2018/un-alliance-aims-to-put-fashion-on-path-to-sustainability/doc.html" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">about 10% of global carbon emissions</a> and almost 20% of waste water.

', "It explicitly rejects a culture of throwaway fashion that's been accelerated by the rise of online fast fashion retailers. ", 'These companies, some of which <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-58409888" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">pay social media influencers to promote and front their brands</a>, can face criticism over <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-53305006" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">claims of worker exploitation</a>, and <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-44968561" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">environmentally harmful working practices</a>.

', 'The research stated that of 2,500 recently added items from each website, 49% were made of plastics such as polyester, acrylic, nylon and elastane.', 'The report\'s co-author Josie Warden said: "The sheer volume of clothing produced by these websites is shocking - we should see many of these items, which go for rock-bottom prices, as akin to other short-lived plastics. The nature of fast fashion trends means they are not designed to have long lives in our wardrobes."', 'According to the Clean Clothes campaign, in 2018 <a href="https://cleanclothes.org/fashions-problems/waste-and-pollution" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">three out of five of our clothing purchases</a> ended up on the landfill site.', 'The RSA is calling for the government to look at introducing a plastics tax on clothes imported into or produced in the UK.', 'Facing a climate of increased environmental awareness, being seen to go green is big business.

However, the RSA report said the company had a "mountain to climb" to meet this target.', 'It follows a host of similar eco-friendly commitments from major clothes retailers. H&amp;M has promised 100% of its materials and products will be recycled or sustainably sourced by 2030. Mango has also pledged to sustainably source 50% by 2022.', 'The industry also grouped together to form <a href="https://www.globalfashionagenda.com/" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">the Global Fashion Agenda</a> - with brands signing up to a number of 2020 sustainability goals, as well as <a href="https://www.globalfashionagenda.com/" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">the Circular Fashion Partnership</a>, working to find green solutions to offset the impact of the pandemic.

', '"Tencel\'s production process is closed loop, meaning more than 99% of the water and solvents used in the process are collected and reused. Meanwhile the bleaching of fibres is completely chlorine free," the label said.', 'But why should companies commit to such a change in outlook? ', 'Dr Bernice Pan, CEO of the sustainable fashion label Deploy, says the pandemic, on top of the worsening environmental landscape, has intensified limits on resources and forced companies to rethink their long-term strategy.', '"It can\'t just be about quantity and speed any more. And certainly just pumping out quantity isn\'t going to help companies grow" she says.', 'Pan believes the focus now needs to be on providing "quality, versatility, fashion and function for customers to produce maximum value".', 'Part of this involves making clothes that are reusable and multipurpose: "If you can give people a skirt that they can attach to another new top, and then there\'s another dress again. The concept shift needs to happen."', 'Vintage and second-hand clothing markets like Depop have also increased the lifespan of clothing.', 'The social shopping app blends the aesthetic and social aspects of Instagram with the buy-and-sell format of eBay. It was established in 2011 and now has more than 15 million users in 147 countries, enjoying a further boom in lockdown.', 'Depop is not the only app targeting this space - many second-hand clothes are traded on eBay, and Asos now has a Marketplace feature which allows users to resell used clothes.', 'A major barrier limiting the pace of sustainable fashion is its high price - for both consumers and fashion labels. ', "For instance, an off-the-peg version of Hannah's dress, available for pre-order, presently costs hundreds of pounds.", 'These prices are often driven by the increased cost of sustainable production techniques, says Pan. "A lot of the new technology is not fully commercialised because not enough brands buy it." ', 'This is in part due to consumer demand. Fast fashion retailers such as Boohoo and Oh Polly were <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-55773751" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">able to quickly react during the pandemic</a> because, for them, the time between finishing a design to getting it made is often less than a week.', 'Boohoo has been one of the best performers in terms of online retail - it increased quarterly sales by 45% to £368m in the three months until the end of May 2020.', 'For this to change, Pan says "customers need to reject these irresponsible production models, then brands will have no choice but to change and adopt new practices".', '"When we buy a £10 disposable t-shirt, the true cost to the environment and society is a lot more. So the question is, are we willing to pay for something disposable, even it means we have a toxic future to worry about, or are we happier to pay for fewer items that are made more environmental processes and fair labour treatment?"', 'The key to change, Pan believes, is government legislation to back up increased awareness amongst consumers. She cites the shifting attitude toward the tobacco industry in the name of public health as a template.', 'Pan says the pandemic, which has hit traditional retailers hard, can be the perfect reset point. The COP26 environmental summit in November, led by UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, is set to discuss sustainable fashion.', 'Earlier this month Stockholm Fashion Week set a strong precedent by focusing on addressing sustainability, technology and creativity in the industry.', '"Universally agreed upon are several issues plaguing the industry" <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/roxannerobinson/2021/09/06/sustainable-in-sweden-stockholm-fashion-week-returns-with-a-focus-on-the-future" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">wrote Forbes</a>, from overproduction to misjudging consumer want and harmful working practices. ', '"The solutions to these issues will rely heavily on tech, legislation, financing, and collaboration across the industry, [one] notorious for not working together. It is also highly unregulated" it continued.', '"The industry needs to make strides to change either from a moral obligation or demand imposed by the consumer".', 'Prof Fletcher agrees. "The future for fashion is exciting" she says. "It is also different to today - the fashion industry will take a smaller and less central role. Instead there will be many small and different fashion initiatives all working to provide for and express our fashion identities within ecological realities."', '<i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">Follow us on </i><a href="https://www.facebook.com/BBCEntsNews/" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Facebook</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">, or on Twitter </i><a href="https://twitter.com/BBCNewsEnts" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">@BBCNewsEnts</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">.
