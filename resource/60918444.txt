['<b class="ssrcss-hmf8ql-BoldText e5tfeyi3">Unions have criticised government plans to tackle the so-called fire and rehire of workers in the wake of P&amp;O Ferries sacking 800 employees without notice.  </b>', 'Business Minister Paul Scully has revealed legislation to "clamp down" on "unscrupulous" employers who fail to hold meaningful staff consultations.', 'But the Trades Union Congress (TUC) said the plans "lack bite".', 'Labour said the move was "too little, too late" and would "offer no comfort" to P&amp;O Ferries\' sacked workers.', 'The practice of fire and rehire is when an employer dismisses a worker and rehires them on new, less-favourable terms. ', 'The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said a new statutory code of practice would detail how businesses "must hold fair, transparent and meaningful consultations on proposed changes to employment terms".', "The new legislation would aim to act as a deterrent, the government said, including a measure where courts or tribunals can increase an employee's compensation by 25% if an employer fails to comply with the code.", 'The government said it had "always been clear" that using fire and rehire as a "negotiating tactic is completely unacceptable", and said it expected companies to treat employees fairly.', 'However, it added in light of "the disgraceful actions of P&amp;O Ferries in sacking 800 workers on the spot without consultation", it recognised "the need for greater clarity for employers".
