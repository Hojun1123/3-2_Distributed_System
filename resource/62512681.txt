', "Himars can also fire a single Army Tactical Missile System missile, which has a range of 186 miles (300 km). However, the US isn't supplying Ukraine with these.", 'The 50-mile range is roughly similar to that of Russian Smerch missiles, but Himars fires GPS-guided missiles which can be more accurately targeted.', "Himars began being used in Ukraine at the end of June or the start of July, according to Phillips O'Brien, professor of strategic studies at St Andrews University.", 'He says the system was first deployed against <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-62132441" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">fixed targets and command centres</a>, rather than forces on the move:', '"It was used up and down the front in eastern Ukraine, striking at ammunition depots some 30 miles behind the Russian lines."', 'However, he says, Ukraine may now be starting to use Himars against concentrations of Russian troops in barracks and command posts.', 'Ukraine claims <a href="https://euromaidanpress.com/2022/08/17/russo-ukrainian-war-day-175-another-explosion-in-crimea/" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">a missile attack in Lysychansk, Luhansk</a> killed up to 100 troops, and that a <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-62547403" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">strike on the headquarters of the Wagner mercenary group</a> in Popasna in Luhansk may have killed 100 of its members.

', '"Himars is very accurate when it is used against fixed targets, when you have the exact co-ordinates," she says.
