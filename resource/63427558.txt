"I\'d do it all again in a heartbeat and watching how it is all put together is just as exciting as the show.', '"It\'s the best night out I\'ve ever had, I loved the whole weekend, the whole experience, even the queuing, it\'s so much better than just buying a ticket and going to a show."', "Just behind the Wratchfords were Fran Clarke, 44, and her daughter Victoria O'Brien, 26, from Bristol.
