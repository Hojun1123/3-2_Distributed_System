', '"The best way to take care of my band and crew and my family is to distance myself from this tour [but] not this conversation," she added.', 'The allegations against Butler emerged in an investigation by music publication Pitchfork. ', 'The three women, and one gender-fluid person, accused the singer of taking advantage of his fame and their fandom during incidents that occurred between 2015 and 2020, when Butler was aged between 34 and 39.', 'In two statements to Pitchfork, Butler denied all allegations, saying that sexual interactions he had with the four people were consensual, but apologised "to anyone who I have hurt with my behaviour".', 'Writing on social media, Feist said she had learned of the allegations against Butler at the same time as everyone else.', '"I read the same headline you did," said the singer, whose full name is Leslie Feist. ', '"We didn\'t have any time to prepare for what was coming, let alone a chance to decide not to fly across the ocean into the belly of this situation.

", 'However, she then went on to explain her decision to pull out. ', '"The last two nights on stage, my songs made this decision for me," she wrote. ', '"Hearing them through this lens was incongruous with what I\'ve worked to clarify for myself through my whole career.

", '"I know what is in his heart, and I know he has never, and would never, touch a woman without her consent and I am certain he never did," she said. ', '"He has lost his way and he has found his way back. I love him and love the life we have created together."', '<i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">Follow us on </i><a href="https://www.facebook.com/BBCEntsNews/" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Facebook</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">, or on Twitter </i><a href="https://twitter.com/BBCNewsEnts" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">@BBCNewsEnts</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">.
