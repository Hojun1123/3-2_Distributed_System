But Amnesty International called it "inexcusable".', 'In the end, the report was made public just 13 minutes before the end of her four-year tenure.', 'And while it has been welcomed by many, some have expressed disappointment - including the World Uyghur Conference. Spokesman Zumretay Arkin said they had "expected her to be firmer on China overall".

Germany has called for the release of all arbitrarily detained Uyghurs.', 'However, there is unlikely to be much pressure from inside China: the issue of Uyghur human rights abuses has long been a taboo topic and heavily censored - as of Thursday afternoon, the UN report had yet to be mentioned in Chinese mainstream media or social media platforms.
