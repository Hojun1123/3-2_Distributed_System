['<b class="ssrcss-hmf8ql-BoldText e5tfeyi3">Firmus Energy has announced a price increase of 37% for natural gas customers in the Belfast area. </b>', 'The rise, which will affect about 47,000 customers, will come into effect on 3 May.', 'It comes days after <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-60941067" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Firmus announced its prices for gas will increase by 16.3% in its Ten Towns network</a>.', 'That increase, which will affect about 55,000 customers, will take effect from the same date. ', 'The managing director of Firmus Energy, Niall Martindale, said the company hoped to announce price decreases "as soon as we can possibly do so".', 'Appearing before a committee of Derry City and Strabane District Council on Tuesday, he said the company had "sympathy and empathy with customers".', '"The tariffs we have had to regrettably implement over the last number of months are reflective of the wholesale market," he continued.', '"What we want to do as a business is remain strong through this period. ', '"We want to remain strong for customers to get through this crisis so we come the other side in a stronger and better place."', 'The Consumer Council said the 37% price rise for Belfast customers would see the average bill rise by about £330 per year.', '"While this price rise was expected due to sustained increases in global wholesale gas costs and having seen Firmus Energy Ten Towns and SSE Airtricity Belfast price rises, it makes it no less challenging for households to absorb," the council\'s Raymond Gormley said. ', '"The global wholesale price increase, exacerbated by the conflict in Ukraine, follows well-publicised rises in home heating oil, coal, electricity, grocery and transport fuel costs. ', '"This is particularly bad news for consumers in vulnerable situations and low-income households. ', '"It also means a wider group of households than before are having their budgets stretched ever further. ', '"Unlike the consumers in the Ten Towns network, gas consumers in the Greater Belfast area have the opportunity to switch supplier and the Consumer Council encourage customers to check they have the best deal before 2 May 2022 when the opt-out period ends. ', '"It is also worth checking if you are on the cheapest electricity tariff."  ', "The Utility Regulator had warned in January that gas prices would increase with the wholesale price of gas making up more than half of consumers' bills.", 'A worldwide squeeze on energy supplies pushed the price up last year.', "But wholesale prices have risen even higher since the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, which is the world's largest natural gas exporter.", 'The UK gets little of its gas from Russia directly, but prices could still be driven up worldwide if Russian supplies to Europe were affected.', 'In January, an <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-59870371" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">emergency winter fuel payment scheme</a> opened for applications, with 11 companies from across the energy sector pledging more than £250,000 in donations to the scheme.', 'This scheme closed for applications last week.', '© 2022 BBC.
