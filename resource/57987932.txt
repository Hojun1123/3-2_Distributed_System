', 'A surge in these searches in parts of London, under a knife crime initiative called Operation Blunt 2, had no effect on police recorded crime compared with boroughs where the searches were not brought in. ', 'And nationally there is no clear correlation between the number of searches and the number of offences. From 2010, fewer people were stopped and searched and there was also a fall in knife crime. Then, around 2014, knife crime started to rise again while the number of stops continued falling. ', 'But, when the use of stop and search fell, the <i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">proportion </i>of stops resulting in an arrest did rise. In other words, when the police could search more people indiscriminately, they stopped many more people who weren\'t committing a crime.

', "Defending his government's record on crime, Mr Johnson pointed to falls in various offences over the past year. His figures are broadly correct but any implication that this is because of government investment in policing would be misleading.
