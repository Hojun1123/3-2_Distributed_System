If anyone makes the mistake thinking they can upload illegal content, we will report them," she says. "We\'re truly the safest and most inclusive social media platform."', 'However, Newsnight has found further evidence that the site is failing to prevent illegal content from appearing on its site.', 'A US investigator says that in just an hour they were able to find ten child abuse images on other platforms that had originated on OnlyFans. They believe the photos have been created within the last six months and include watermarks from the website. ', 'Some images show pre-pubescent children being directed to produce abusive images, according to the agent, who specialises in investigating paedophile rings online.', '"The youngest was around five years old," the investigator told the BBC, adding that others were about 12 years of age.

Its users spent more than £4bn on purchasing photos and videos shared on the site, last year.', 'Ms Gan said 80% of the company\'s staff work on content moderation and it would continue to invest in this area. She also said the website\'s decision, last year, to ban pornography - which was quickly reversed - was a "learning experience".', "OnlyFans is not alone in taking steps to address online safety. The government's long-delayed online safety bill proposes heavy fines for websites failing to protect children. ", "Last year, it also provided Ofcom with limited powers to penalise companies which are allowing harmful content on video-sharing platforms. But Ofcom's role does not involve assessing individual videos and no companies have been sanctioned to date.", 'The NSPCC said neither the current regulation nor the planned legislation go far enough.
