Land that can\'t be used productively for food or housing and that\'s not in the greenbelt."', 'She added: "We are actively looking at that."', 'Ms Hayden explained that while the authority cannot decide whether or not private land is turned into energy farms, the roofs of council buildings could be a possible location.', 'Liberal Democrat councillor Conrad Hart-Brooke backed the plan, saying: "One thing we do have a lot of in the UK are roofs, which are exactly the right place for solar panels because they\'re already there."', '<i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">Follow BBC Yorkshire on </i><a href="https://www.facebook.com/BBCYorkshire/" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Facebook</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">, </i><a href="https://twitter.com/bbclooknorth" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Twitter</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2"> and </i><a href="https://www.instagram.com/bbcyorkshire/" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Instagram</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">.
