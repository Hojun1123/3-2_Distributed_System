', 'And Covid-related calls which went through to the core NHS 111 service were not always redirected to the Covid service, and some were never recorded.', 'The HSIB says the knock-on effect of messaging to stay at home in the early months of the pandemic "may have impacted on patients\' willingness to seek medical advice from elsewhere (such as their GP)", even if their condition got worse.', 'Amber Sargent, national investigator at HSIB, said systems had to be put in place at short notice and there were many unknowns when the NHS started tackling a brand new coronavirus in 2020.', 'She said: "Anyone may need to access NHS 111 or other telephone triage when there is an emerging healthcare crisis. ', '"It is critical that services can be stood up within a short timeframe and that communication of messages and advice to the public is as clear as possible to help them get the crucial care and treatment they may need."', '"Call handlers followed guidance set out by Public Health England which was regularly updated as the understanding of Covid-19 improved, and the NHS has captured learning throughout the last two years to contribute to the response to any future pandemic," an NHS spokesperson said.', 'In future, advice on symptoms to look out for, where to go for medical help and what to do if their condition worsens should be clearly provided, the report said.', 'To improve the safety of the NHS 111 service in another pandemic, the report recommends that the language used by health advisers does not deter seriously unwell people from calling back or seeking help.', 'It also notes the benefits of face-to-face assessment for callers with other health conditions faced with a new virus.', 'The HSIB carries out investigations of patient safety concerns in NHS-funded care in England.', 'It noted that the UK Health Security Agency had taken some steps to try to improve safety.
