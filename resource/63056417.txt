', 'Importers facing invoices increasing by thousands of pounds, which are worth little more than a dollar. ', 'The movements up and down by half a percentage point in the effective borrowing cost for British government debt are incredible. ', 'A sterling slump starting during a budgetary statement is the great terror the Treasury always fears, but never actually happens. Until now.', "But even I was taken aback by the interjection of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in its direct, uncompromising, unflinching and somewhat humiliating criticism of the government's fiscal plan. ", 'Not only did the world\'s most important international financial institution suggest the plan was economically risky, it said it was likely to increase inequality and recommended taking an "early opportunity" for a re-evaluation of the policies in the coming weeks, on a specific date. ', 'The criticism came as Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng reiterated he was sticking to a plan only outlined four days ago.', "The stinging rebuke from the International Monetary Fund reflected similar concerns from the world's major finance ministries that a crisis brewing in the UK could spill over into a global slowdown.", 'The criticism from the Washington-based body was without a clear precedent in regard to a major G7 country and shareholder. ', 'UK developments are being "closely monitored", it said.
