', '<a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/LSB/LSB10565" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">The Congressional Research Service reported</a> that "most scholars who have closely examined the question have concluded that Congress has authority to extend the impeachment process to officials who are no longer in office".', 'Until now, there has been no case of a president being tried in the Senate after leaving office, although other government officials have been.', "In 1876, the House impeached President Ulysses S Grant's war secretary, William Belknap, even after he resigned from his post. The Senate considered whether it still had jurisdiction to hear the case of a former official, and determined that it did.

In contrast he used the word "fight" 14 times, although he never explicitly directed his supporters to enter the Capitol building.', 'His lawyers say the rhetoric was in regards to the need to fight for more election security.', "It's also important to note that protesters were already planning on marching to the US Capitol, and some were heading that way before Mr Trump finished speaking.", 'The Democrats point to further examples of the president encouraging violence in the months leading up to the riot. For example, in the first presidential debate, Mr Trump told the Proud Boys, a violent far-right group, to "stand back and stand by".', 'He also denounced violence on several other occasions, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-us-2020-54381500" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">including condemning the Proud Boys and other far-right groups</a> following the first of the presidential debates.', '<a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/01/06/politics/pence-national-guard/index.html" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">US media reported</a> that Mr Trump initially resisted sending in reinforcements to the Capitol, and his vice-president, Mike Pence, ultimately approved the deployment of the National Guard.', 'The Democrats say this represents a "dereliction of duty", citing the press reports which are yet to be confirmed publicly by Mr Pence or anyone else from within Mr Trump\'s cabinet. ', 'Defense Department officials say that the Capitol Police did not request additional help from National Guard troops prior to the riot.', 'Mr Trump\'s former chief of staff, Mark Meadows, has also pushed back on this assertion, saying the president "literally at the very first said we need to make sure they have the resources".', 'About two-and-a-half hours after Mr Trump\'s speech ended, the White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany tweeted: "At President Donald Trump\'s direction, the National Guard is on the way along with other federal protective services."', 'Democrats say Mr Trump presented his supporters with a series of false claims about the election result in the build-up to the Capitol riot.', "Mr Trump's lawyers argue he has the the right to express his opinion on the election result and other matters - pointing to the first amendment of the US constitution which protects freedom of speech.", '<a href="https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/first-amendment-lawyers-trump-impeachment-defense/7fc3e63ae077f83d/full.pdf" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">A letter signed by 144 constitutional lawyers argues</a> that this protection could apply as a defence in legal proceedings, but not to an impeachment trial.', 'These lawyers say that the Senate is determining whether to convict Mr Trump based on the president violating his oath of office, rather than if he acted illegally.', '<a href="https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/trump-brief-defense-impeachment/bd873567d385cdcc/full.pdf" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Mr Trump\'s lawyers have also said</a> there is "insufficient evidence" to disprove there was widespread election fraud, although this isn\'t expected to feature as an argument during the Senate trial.', 'The allegations of fraud have been rejected by the courts, with more than 50 legal challenges to the election results failing to provide adequate evidence.
