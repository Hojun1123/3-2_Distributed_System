['<b class="ssrcss-hmf8ql-BoldText e5tfeyi3">Labour leader Keir Starmer has been appearing on BBC local radio stations while shadow levelling up secretary Lisa Nandy made an appearance on Radio 4.</b>', "We've been looking at some of their claims.", 'Ms Nandy used an average mortgage increase figure for the UK - Keir Starmer used a number of different figures for the areas covered by the BBC local radio stations he was speaking to.', 'This is how they worked it out:', 'The interest rate of a typical two-year fixed rate mortgage <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-63144506" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">breached 6% on Wednesday</a> for the first time since 2008.', 'But Sir Keir and Ms Nandy were clear they were talking about the extra costs from "this government\'s decision to crash the economy", referring to the "mini-budget" on 23 September. But it has to be pointed out that mortgage rates had already been rising before Liz Truss became prime minister.', 'The corresponding average two-year fixed rate at the end of August this year, just before she came to office, was 3.64%, which would mean a monthly payment of £1,274. From there, the difference made by a 6% rate would be £284, which is considerably less than the £500 claimed by Labour.', "It's also likely that some of that increase in mortgage rates since the end of August has been due to international factors that cannot be blamed on Liz Truss' government.", 'We\'ve looked at this claim from the Labour leader <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/63051962" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">before</a>, which we have been told comes from a Bloomberg article.', 'But the article suggested that the excess profits for UK gas producers and electricity generators could come in the next two years. They have not already been made, as Sir Keir told BBC Radio Leicester.', 'There are other questions over the £170bn figure, which the article says came from Treasury analysis, although the Treasury says it does not recognise the figure.', 'We have not been able to reproduce the figure, especially if you are only looking at profits from the North Sea, which are the ones that would be subject to an additional windfall tax.', "The shadow levelling up secretary told BBC Radio 4's Today that one of the ways Labour would do things differently was not cutting corporation tax (which businesses pay on their profits) to 19%.", 'Actually, corporation tax is already 19%, and has been since April 2017.', 'Former chancellor Rishi Sunak announced in March 2021 that it would increase to 25% from April 2023, but the government has now decided to cancel that increase.', 'Labour has previously said that it would go ahead with raising that tax.', '<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-41928747" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?
