They have my support."', 'Ms Jones asked Business Secretary Grant Shapps to publicise the security assessment that prompted the decision.', 'Mr Shapps acknowledged it was a "concerning time for 500 or so employees" at Newport Wafer Fab.', 'But added: "She is not privy to the information that I have had to weigh up in order to come to this national security decision.', '"Nor can I am afraid accede to her request to publish that information."', 'Tonia Antoniazzi, Labour MP for Gower, asked if Mr Shapps was concerned that the plant\'s employees "had threatened to walk out if the previous owner or investment fund takes over ownership".', 'Mr Shapps said he heard what she said and was "very conscious of her comments".', '"The government\'s involvement is looking at the national security aspects of this but as a government we want to see good employers everywhere".', 'Labour Shadow Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said: "The chaotic process and the lack of strategy from the government have left workers and businesses facing a great deal of uncertainty," saying it took ministers 16 months to make this decision.', 'Mr Shapps replied that it was a "rather unfair assessment of what\'s happened", saying the relevant legislation "only came into existence this January, so to say there has been 16 months during which we have not made any decisions is simply untrue".', 'Â© 2022 BBC.
