', '"As he moves away, I go closer and take some pictures and see if I can identify them while underwater."', 'They often see one of two seahorses during a dive who they hope will help with the winter project.', '"A male we have named \'Snailhead\' - because he had a snail on the top of his crown the first time we saw him and a female who we think is his partner - \'Snailless\'!', '"Their territories seem to overlap but we have never seen them both on the same dive. Hopefully the surveys will tell us more about how big their territories are," Chloe said.', 'Once back on dry land their pair write a detailed report from every dive and send it to the Seahorse Trust. The reports are collated by the trust each year and submitted to The Marine Management Organisation (MMO).', 'The pair, who started weekly dives in September, expect to reveal the findings from their winter dives in the spring.', '<i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">Source:  </i><a href="https://www.theseahorsetrust.org/" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">The Seahorse Trust</a>', '<i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">Follow BBC South on </i><a href="https://www.facebook.com/bbcsouthnews/" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Facebook</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">, </i><a href="https://twitter.com/bbcsouthnews" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Twitter</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">, or </i><a href="https://www.instagram.com/bbcsouthnews" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Instagram</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">.
