Pubs in particular are seeing their energy costs soar by as much as 300%, and bosses of six of the country\'s largest breweries <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-62688692" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">have called for "immediate government intervention".</a>', '"One of the big measures we are asking for, and have been for some time, is for Covid-style support to be given by measure of a government emergency energy grant for all SMEs," said Baroness Ruby.', '"I think unless there is immediate and urgent support, we will see many businesses close their doors this winter."<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-62764121" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Warning firms will close this winter without help</a>', 'The BCC president said measures reportedly suggested by Mr Zahawi, including reductions in VAT and business rates for retail and hospitality and tax breaks for energy intensive industries, was the "right territory" to help people this winter.', '"We cannot be in a situation where more and more businesses are shutting down, because of costs that are absolutely outside of their control," she added.', '"We are not just talking about big businesses, we are talking more and more and more SMEs which are the lifeblood of our economy.
