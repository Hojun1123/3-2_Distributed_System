', 'It said there was also a "lack of consistency" in reporting incidents to the local authority, including some that had resulted in injuries. ', 'Although the CQC said the home was "visibly clean", assessments were not carried out to the correct standards. ', 'One resident\'s support plan described them as "ignorant" and "rude". ', 'It also focused on the impact of their behaviour on staff and not how best to minimise and respond to it, the CQC said. ', "It rated the home's safety and leadership as inadequate and found that its effectiveness required improvement.
