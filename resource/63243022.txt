', 'In her report, she drew on the findings of senior midwife Donna Ockenden and said mistakes had been made and "not everything was handled as it should have been" but this did not amount to serious mismanagement on Mr Reid\'s part.', '"This does not mean that everything he did was right, or not the subject of criticism," she added.', 'Ms Scolding found that while Mr Reid did take steps to improve patient safety, he had not been "given the relevant information to make a strategic difference". ', 'She said that there was "no doubt" there had been "obfuscations, difficulties and failures" in respect of Kate\'s death, however she did not consider that Mr Reid "lied" or "acted unethically", adding that he had been ill-advised by others about what was best for the trust.', 'A board meeting in October 2018, in which Mr Stanton was spoken over and his microphone was switched off, "was not well handled" Ms Scolding said, but did not amount to serious mismanagement.  ', 'She concluded Mr Reid had "inherited a Trust which was institutionally defensive about maternity care, and which was seriously dysfunctional" but the responsibility did not lie solely with him.', '"I think this report demonstrates some of the fire fighting and dysfunctionality of this Trust and the absolute state they were in, and possibly still are in to this day, on being unable to address any of the issues that were current," said Mr Stanton. ', 'The couple said there was "no appetite" for learning or change at SaTH which they said was "wedded to its toxic culture, embedded from the board to the ward".', 'The trust\'s current chair, Dr Catriona McMahon, apologised to Ms Davies and Mr Stanton for their loss "and the way in which the trust dealt with their concerns".', '"Our aim in commissioning this independent report was to investigate, transparently, the complaints made against the former chair and we have committed to follow-through with actions to address the issues it highlights," she said.', '<i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">Follow BBC West Midlands on </i><a href="https://www.facebook.com/MidlandsBBC/" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Facebook</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">, </i><a href="https://twitter.com/bbcmtd" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Twitter</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2"> and </i><a href="https://www.instagram.com/bbc_midlands/?hl=en" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Instagram</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">.
