', 'Winter 2017 saw a particularly severe strain of flu, which had a large impact on older people.', 'The latest estimates of Covid infections for the week ending 8 November <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/bulletins/coronaviruscovid19infectionsurveypilot/11november2022" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">decreased from the week before</a>, with an estimated one in every 55 people infected.', 'Virus levels fell in all UK nations and every English region, according to the ONS.

This figure is over 196,000, although both Scotland and Northern Ireland have stopped reporting this measure.', 'According to a count of death certificates that mention Covid-19, the death toll of the virus has climbed higher than 208,000.', 'The third measure counts all deaths over and above the expected number since the pandemic began - that figure was almost 179,000 as of 4 November.
