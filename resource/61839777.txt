That's a rise of 43%.", 'Experts say two new fast-spreading subvariants of Omicron  -called BA.4 and BA.5 - are behind some of the new infections.', 'People can catch them even if they have recently had other types of Covid.', 'The Office for National Statistics (ONS), which compiles the data, says it is too early to say if this is the start of another wave.

Vaccines are still saving lives.', 'Dr Mary Ramsay, from the UK Health Security Agency, said: "It is encouraging that we are not seeing an increase in intensive care unit admissions, but we are monitoring data closely and assessing the possible impact of subvariants BA.4 and BA.5.', '"As we enter summer, it\'s still important to remember that Covid-19 has not gone away, and to get vaccinated to reduce the risk of becoming seriously ill with the virus."', 'BA.4 and BA.5 were first identified in South Africa at the start of the year and may soon become the dominant strains in Europe and the US, health experts say.', 'Ever since it first emerged, Covid has been mutating or shape-shifting, creating new variants and subvariants. ', 'Lots of people have built up some immunity from past infections and vaccination, which is helping to make Covid less risky overall.', 'But the new subvariants do appear to be spreading more easily. This is partly because immunity may be waning, but also because of the genetic mutations which the virus has undergone.', 'Many countries have also lifted their Covid restrictions, meaning people are mixing more, which gives the virus more chances to spread.', 'World Cup winner Jürgen Klinsmann invites you to subscribe to his daily World Cup newsletter.', '© 2022 BBC.
