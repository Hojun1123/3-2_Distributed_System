', 'The department has not put a figure on what it calls the "fiscal black hole" facing the UK, the BBC has previously been told it may be at least £50bn.', 'Mr Hunt is now due to deliver a financial statement on 17 November, after the much-anticipated plan was pushed back by two weeks after Mr Sunak replaced Liz Truss in Downing Street.', "Few concrete details of the government's plans have emerged, but reports have suggested ministers could extend a freeze on income tax thresholds, dragging more people into the higher rate.", 'The Daily Telegraph has reported that Mr Hunt is planning to fill the budgetary shortfall through a combination of 50% tax rises and 50% cuts to public spending.
