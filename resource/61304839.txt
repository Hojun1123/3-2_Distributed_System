', 'It found the busiest month for transactions on the pre-paid cards was November, a month when retail spending is traditionally high before Christmas.', 'They suggested these factors meant an increase in spending in Northern Ireland was "much lower than was originally intended or would have been hoped for".', '"A post-scheme evaluation needs to happen to determine whether this policy experimentation was cost-effective and worth repeating," the assessment concluded.', 'The scheme opened for applications on 27 September 2021 and was supposed to close on 30 November, but the deadline for spending the cards was extended a number of times due to various problems and delays.', '© 2022 BBC.
