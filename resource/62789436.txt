He was seeking $150,000 (£130,000) in damages.', 'Photographer Kirk Weddle was among the defendants, as were former Nirvana members Dave Grohl and Krist Novoselic, as well as Courtney Love, the widow of late singer Kurt Cobain.', 'Mr Elden filed his case in 2021, arguing that he was still within his rights to complain about the decades-old image because it had continued to cause him distress and lost earnings into adulthood.', 'The lawsuit was dismissed and then re-filed in January.', 'The Los Angeles judge ruled on Friday that Mr Elden lodged his case well beyond the 10-year statute of limitations.', 'Welcoming the verdict, a defence lawyer said the case had been "meritless".
