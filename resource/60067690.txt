It worked closely with Beijing Forestry University, and claims that more than 90% of the trees have survived the move.', 'But Dr Carmen de Jong, Professor of Hydrology at the University of Strasbourg, says the removal of the topsoil in this process could significantly increase the risk of erosion and landslides, water pollution and damage to animal habitats.', '"The nature reserve has lost about 25% of its surface….which has very high biodiversity and protected species such as the golden eagle."', 'The BOC was alerted to the potential environmental risk in this area as early as 2015 by Chinese biologists, but the site was not moved elsewhere.', '<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2015.18174?proof=t" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">The journal Nature reported at the time</a> that posts on the issue on Chinese social media site Weibo were removed.

', 'Yanqing, the site of the ski centre, only receives an average of 21cm (just over eight inches) a year of snowfall.', 'But this venue alone needs more than 1.2 million cubic metres of snow for Olympic events. So instead, for the first time, 100% artificial snow will be used.', 'The process of producing artificial snow is both energy and resource-intensive.

', 'It said Beijing\'s "reliance on artificial snowmaking would require [the] diversion of water from existing reservoirs and may impact other land uses."', 'In response to the concerns, Beijing insists the water used for the Olympics accounts for less than 2% of the local water supply. It also says the snow cannons being used need 20% less energy than ones used in previous games. ', 'The organisers wanted the Beijing Winter Olympics to be the "first carbon-neutral Games". China has set an ambitious goal of delivering the games using 100% renewable energy.', 'Over six years, the organisers have been constructing new wind and solar projects to deliver enough clean energy, not just for the Games, but for the whole of Beijing.

', 'The authorities have also announced restrictions in the Beijing area on vehicles and industries that emit the most CO2. The organisers have incidentally managed to reduce travel emissions by deciding not to let in foreign spectators for Covid safety reasons - with only local spectators allowed.', 'And they say any remaining emissions will be offset by planting <a href="https://library.olympics.com/Default/doc/SYRACUSE/353573/sustainability-plan-beijing-2022-olympic-and-paralympic-winter-games-beijing-organising-committee-fo?_lg=en-GB" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">80,000 hectares (nearly 198,000 acres) of trees</a> around Beijing.
