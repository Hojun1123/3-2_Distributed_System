['<b class="ssrcss-hmf8ql-BoldText e5tfeyi3">Some of the UK\'s top music acts have spoken about the healing power of music, after a poll for the BBC indicated it\'s where many young people turn when they want to feel better.</b>', 'BBC Newsbeat grabbed the Mercury-nominated acts Nova Twins, Wet Leg and Kojey Radical to ask them about it.', 'They told us about some of their go-to tracks when they want to chill out or cheer up.', 'And they also spoke about how it feels to know that their music helps others.', 'The online poll, <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/news/documents/2022-10/bbc-radio-1-newsbeat-youth-in-society-ipsos-tables-weighted.pdf" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">conducted by Ipsos</a> on behalf of Radio 1 and BBC Newsbeat, asked a representative sample of 2,719 British young people - 16 to 24-year-olds - about their lives.

It\'s actually affecting people in so many records that we love and listen to.', '"Whether it\'s good, bad or sad, you want something from the music. So as long as it\'s your something, that\'s a good thing."', "Amy namechecked James Blake and Melody Gardot as artists she likes to listen to when she's feeling sad.

', '"In a couple of my sessions with a few clients who have been suffering from anxiety we have a drumming circle and we discuss the things that make us feel anxious - if somebody is feeling really stressed out they might crash the cymbal angrily."', 'Daryl also uses unconventional instruments in his sessions. He says a rain stick - a hollow tube filled with small beads that makes a rain sound when turned upside down - can help people with ADHD.', '"Counsellors usually use talking as their main tool - we use music and the music can take different forms," he says.', '"It could be improvisation - playing together in a group or in a one-to-one setting.', '"They might take one half of the piano then I might take the other and we will jam.', '"It\'s building a connection through music."', '<i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">Follow Newsbeat on </i><a href="https://www.instagram.com/bbcnewsbeat/" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Instagram</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">, </i><a href="https://www.facebook.com/bbcnewsbeat/" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Facebook</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">, </i><a href="https://twitter.com/BBCNewsbeat" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Twitter</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2"> and </i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe1Ef-K5jpnRsmVY5hCBhOw" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">YouTube</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">.</i>', '<i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">Listen to Newsbeat </i><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/live:bbc_radio_one" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">live</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2"> at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back </i><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006wkry/episodes/player" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">here</a>.', 'World Cup winner Jürgen Klinsmann invites you to subscribe to his daily World Cup newsletter.', '© 2022 BBC.
