', '"Covid is certainly not away, our hospitals are busy, there are patients in the hospitals with Covid so it is still very much around and in our community at the moment."', 'In the week ending 23 October, there were on average 874 patients in hospital with the virus, a slight decrease from the previous week, according to the National Records of Scotland.', '<a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/bulletins/coronaviruscovid19infectionsurveypilot/21october2022" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">The Office for National Statistics Covid infection survey</a> estimates an average of 144,400 people were infected on any given day in the week up to 10 October - that\'s about one in 35 people.', "Prof Jason Leitch, Scotland's national clinical director, told BBC Scotland he didn't think there was vaccine fatigue but highlighted frustration with getting appointments and having to travel.

"It\'s a challenge every year with getting that flu vaccine number up, I\'m confident we\'ll get there, we just need to make it as simple as we possibly can for them."', 'Prof Leitch said the vaccine had been a game changer.

', 'She said: "Your time is precious when you are off and you are expected to go and get a booster, you are to make the arrangements, it is not always a convenient thing to do, you have to make your own way and it is very necessary to have the protection to safeguard our service users.  ', '"It is always very difficult for project managers to leave if they are in the middle of a shift because we have such low staff. "', "It is no surprise that there is general vaccine fatigue as this year's campaign is scaled up. Life seems pretty normal. No threat of restrictions, compulsion to wear masks, no need to prove vaccine status in many popular tourist destinations. ", "For many people, navigating an online booking system, perhaps having to travel further or face feeling lousy the next day is not appealing. And some people may believe they have had Covid recently so don't need that additional boost to the immune system. ", 'When it comes to health and social care workers - historically vaccine uptake for things like flu has been lower than officials would desire. It can come down to things like not wanting to take time away from patients when staffing is already tight, or worrying about taking unpaid time off work.  ', 'There is a frustration from unions that more is not being done to make it easier, the government and health boards say they are working to make it as convenient as possible.
