He would buy me expensive things and give me money. ', '"He wanted to know if I had told anyone about what had happened. I still see him sometimes and I get panic attacks when I see him.

We were also sexual with each other when he used to live with us. I know that I was very young and I didn\'t really know what I was doing. ', '"Sometimes I think it was abuse, but sometimes I don\'t.
