['<b class="ssrcss-hmf8ql-BoldText e5tfeyi3">A DVD store that has rented films for almost 40 years is closing its doors, unable to compete with online streaming sites. </b>', 'Flicks in Bournemouth, Dorset, started out in the mid-1980s, when VHS machines were the height of technology. ', 'DVDs and videos from the shop will be sold off and any films left boxed up are set to be put into storage. ', 'Manager Terry Whitaker said one of his suppliers told him there were as few as 10 DVD rental shops left in the UK now.', 'He said he liked remembering the "good old days" but people "watch films differently now". ', 'When Flicks first opened VHS machines were still in use but DVDs soon took over and now streaming sites rule.', 'Mr Whitaker began working at the store 27 years ago.', '"When I started it was part-time, then two years became 10, then 20," he said. "But it never felt like work, I\'ve always enjoyed it here.', '"I found some old VHS machines, they\'re heavy, bulky things, and we kept a stash of the original Star Wars trilogy hidden away. I also found two old Braveheart posters," the 50-year-old said. ', '"With a movie like Crocodile Dundee, people used to have to wait for it to come out on video, then they\'d have to reserve it. Pretty Woman was the same. ', '"You wouldn\'t just walk in on the day it was released, you\'d have to book or pre-book it before it even came out. ', '"Those were the good old days."', 'Mr Whitaker said streaming had made watching films "less of an occasion, definitely". ', '"Back then, you\'d come in as a family and pick a film each and sit round, have the build up and watch it as a family and eat popcorn.', '"But people just watch films differently now, on iPads, phones - people will have two TVs in their homes so they\'ll watch movies separately now", he said. ', 'The store manager said he "wasn\'t too sure" what he would do once the store closed for good. ', '"I\'ve got a couple of months to close down the company yet, then I\'ll find something else," he said.', '"My favourite movie of all time? It changes, but the constant is Dances With Wolves."', '<i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">Follow BBC South on </i><a href="https://www.facebook.com/bbcsouthnews/" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Facebook</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">, </i><a href="https://twitter.com/bbcsouthnews" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Twitter</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">, or </i><a href="https://www.instagram.com/bbcsouthnews" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Instagram</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">.
