Hopefully things can find a way to recover," Mr Bankman-Fried, nicknamed the \'King of Crypto\', wrote on Twitter on Friday. ', '"I was shocked to see things unravel the way they did."', 'Prior to the meltdown, Mr Bankman-Fried had been one of the stars of the crypto scene, drawing comparisons to investment magnate Warren Buffett, with a net worth estimated at more than $15bn (£12.8bn) as recently as Monday.', 'But rumours earlier this week that FTX and other firms owned by Mr Bankman-Fried were on shaky financial ground prompted a mass of customers to try to withdraw funds from FTX, an exchange used to buy and sell digital tokens.
