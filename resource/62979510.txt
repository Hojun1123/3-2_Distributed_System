Therefore, I call upon the UK government to commit to a longer-term plan to give more certainty to enable businesses to cope with persistent high energy costs".', 'Rhian Jones, from Cardiff, said without government help her business would have to close her doors.', 'She opened her shop, called Green Door Bakery, in the Cyncoed area of the city four months ago.', 'Ms Jones said she did not think it would be fair to increase her prices as "everyone\'s in the same boat".', 'Hiking prices, she believed, would mean customers stop coming.
