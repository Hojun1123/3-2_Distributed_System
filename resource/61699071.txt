', 'Among them are hundreds of school pupils and some teachers set to miss school on Monday after half-term.', 'And they face an anxious journey home.', '"Ben was going to have a couple of days at home to get his revision in, prepare mentally for it," said his mother Emma, who did not want their surnames used.', 'After their EasyJet flight home from Paris was cancelled, the earliest flight back that the airline could provide was on Tuesday - too late. ', 'So after spending hundreds of pounds on Eurostar tickets, they are now due to arrive back at home in Stockport by 11:30 BST on Monday evening, in time for the exam on Tuesday morning. ', '"Hopefully he\'ll get there. But there\'s no guarantee," she said. And EasyJet had been "impossible to contact and completely unhelpful", she added. ', 'There are reports that others are even less lucky and are missing GCSE or A-level exams altogether. ', 'Airlines are being blamed for taking more bookings than they can manage with lower post-Covid staffing levels. ', 'But the airlines themselves say the government could also have done more to support the industry during the pandemic and to speed up the process of security checks for new staff now. ', 'Andrew Crawley, chief commercial officer at American Express Global Business Travel, told the BBC\'s Today programme said it would be "sensible" for the government to temporarily change immigration rules to allow airlines to recruit overseas workers to plug staff shortages.', '"Some airlines relied on EU citizens for up to 30% of their workforce, pre-Brexit, so that labour pool no longer being available adds to the challenge that we have here," he said.', 'However, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has rejected such a request from the aviation industry.', 'Hundreds of flights have been cancelled over the past week. While some families never reached their destination or arrived late, others are now finding their return flights are not operating.', 'It is not just exam students - younger children are missing the start of the new half-term too.', '"The curriculum is packed and losing three days from school post-Covid isn\'t good," said father-of-four Joe Murray from Milton Keynes.

It has extended its customer service opening hours from 07:00 to 23:00, and said it was helping those affected find hotel accommodation.', 'Wizz Air also apologised and said passengers would be offered alternative flights, a full refund or 120% in airline credit, which it aimed to process within one week.', 'But the ongoing upheaval will affect children who have not even left home, with some school staff also stranded and unable to get back in time.', 'Kelly and her husband are making their way as fast as they can from Montenegro back to Lincolnshire. After their flight home was cancelled on Sunday, EasyJet offered them an alternative flight on Thursday.', '"We are both teachers so have to get back," says Kelly. So instead they took a bus to Dubrovnik, Croatia, where they waited for more than four hours in the bus station for EasyJet to confirm their accommodation. ', 'They will take a four-hour bus trip to Split on Monday so they can fly from there to Bristol on Tuesday. They will then get a train from Bristol to Gatwick to pick up their car and with a bit of luck be back in the classroom by Wednesday.', '"We do feel really let down by EasyJet," said Kelly.
