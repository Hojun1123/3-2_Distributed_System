For most economists reckon that, even if the government can boost growth, it will realistically need to find savings of perhaps £40bn or more, if it is to bring down debt in a few years. ', "But by anyone's measure that's not small change, it's an amount greater than the defence budget, and won't be raised through efficiency savings. Many public services are already hampered by pandemic disruption and rising inflation.
