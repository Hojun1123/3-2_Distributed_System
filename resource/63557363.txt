', '"This is proof. This is her driving licence from that period, an extremely rare thing. ', '"It made a lot of money considering it was just a piece of paper and a few letters and a few old photographs." ', 'The collection was part of a two-day royal memorabilia auction, with interest shown from all over the world, Mr Grinter said. ', 'A pink satin full-length petticoat, worn by Her Majesty, sold for £3,000, double the asking price.', 'Also among the lots were three Christmas cards, signed by the now Prince and Princess of Wales, William and Catherine.
