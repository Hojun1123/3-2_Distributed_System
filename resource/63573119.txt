', 'They pay £650 a month for their semi-detached home in Gabalfa, Cardiff, with an interest rate of 2.05%.', 'When they remortgage in 2024, a rise to 5.5% would take payments to £950 - average rates <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-63327553" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">topped 6.5% in October</a>.', 'These rate rises mean anyone renewing faces paying hundreds of pounds more a month.', 'Speaking to <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b09fh32m" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Wales Live</a> Vicki said: "Thinking about that and the double whammy of affordability - increased childcare costs, increased energy costs, food, gas and electric, all of them, there is a real question mark for us come remortgage time, if we would pass mortgage affordability.

', 'She has spoken to professionals unofficially who said there was a risk they may not necessarily even be accepted for a remortgage on their home, which they bought for £180,000 in 2017.

I didn\'t feel like there was another choice."', 'The decision to put having another baby on hold is a precaution as much anything, as while they know there are people far worse off than themselves, inflation is causing lots of concern.', '"We are not choosing between heating and eating, but not a lot needs to change to make it difficult," she added.', '"Everything is more expensive - even going swimming has doubled. There is no state of desperation, we are aware of the cost of things and noticing the increase in these costs."', '© 2022 BBC.
