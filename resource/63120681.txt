The blocks are four metres (13ft) tall, and are bridged by 30 lintels.', 'There is a semi-circle within the outer circle, made of 10 shorter pillars and nine horizontal lintels.', 'The centrepiece represents an hourglass and has SOS written in Morse code on the ground.', 'A series of LED lights on the artwork reflects a warming planet, Mr McNamara said.', '"What it\'s about is climate change. It\'s Stonehenge on the outside and an hourglass in the middle," he said, as reported by the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/lnp/ldrs" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Local Democracy Reporting Service</a>.', '"The monolith sits on the neck of the hourglass. And that is basically telling us that time is running out in relation to climate change."', 'Planning Committee member Keith Barber, Conservative, said: "On paper, if it hadn\'t been built I would probably would have said no, but I have seen it and I am quite impressed by it.', 'His fellow Conservative councillor Keith Parker said: "Do I like it? I don\'t know. Is it something special? Yes it is.', '"It is something totally different and it could be something of beauty to a lot of people."', '<i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">Find BBC News: East of England on </i><a href="https://www.facebook.com/bbcnewseast/" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Facebook</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">, </i><a href="https://www.instagram.com/bbceastofengland/" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Instagram</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2"> and </i><a href="https://twitter.com/bbclookeast" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Twitter</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">.
