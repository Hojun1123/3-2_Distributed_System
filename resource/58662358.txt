['<b class="ssrcss-hmf8ql-BoldText e5tfeyi3">Prime Minster Boris Johnson has been addressing the UN General Assembly, ahead of its 26th annual Climate Change Conference of the Parties (Cop26) next month.</b>', 'He made a number of claims - we have checked a selection.', 'The prime minister is right about the general trends but his figures are a bit out of date and do not reflect the extraordinary impact the pandemic has had on both greenhouse-gas emissions and gross domestic product (GDP), the value of everything produced in the economy.', 'His figure of a 44% cut in greenhouse-gas emissions is correct for the period from 1990 to 2019. ', 'Covid led to a big fall in emissions, largely due to reduced use of transport, which means the figure for 1990 to 2020 was <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/972583/2020_Provisional_emissions_statistics_report.pdf" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">a decline of 49%</a>.', 'Similarly, the figure of 78% for the expansion of GDP was for the period from 1990 to 2019 - the figure for 1990 to 2020 was only 60%.', 'The UK has made huge progress in reducing the use of coal, which has been the key contributor to its reduction in emissions since 1990.', '<a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1016822/UK_Energy_in_Brief_2021.pdf#page=30" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Figures for 2020</a> show 1.8% of UK electricity generation came from coal, so Mr Johnson is right about that.', 'It is not clear what age he would describe himself as being a kid, although <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/65896/1_20090729135638_e____dukes60.pdf#page=43" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">the figure for 1970</a>, when he turned six, was 72%, which was also the figure for 1990.', 'It had been 97% in 1950.', 'The UK does indeed have more installed offshore wind capacity than any other country with 10.4GW. ', 'And the government has set a target of increasing this to 40GW by 2030.', 'But if the UK is to become "the Saudi Arabia of wind", as Mr Johnson described it in his UN speech, it has some <a href="https://gwec.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/GWEC-Global-Wind-Report-2021.pdf" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">catching up to do</a> in onshore wind generation.
