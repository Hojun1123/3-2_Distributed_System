So I\'m all about fighting for people whose voices tend to be silenced," she says.', '"That\'s always been within me to do, but 1Xtra gave me the confidence to do it, and the way that I\'ve continued to do it in my career."', 'Charlene says covering issues at 1Xtra meant telling stories that "impacted the environments we\'d grown up with, impacted our mates, people up and down the country" but were not seen widely in the media.', 'She describes the team she was in as "one of the most diverse", and says they "loved the culture, the music and from that came stories that you wouldn\'t see anywhere else".', 'The biggest story she covered at the time was <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-45601867" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">the death of two young girls, Charlene Ellis, 18, and Letisha Shakespeare, 17,</a> who were shot in Aston, Birmingham, on 2 January 2003.', 'Charlene says much of the media coverage at the time didn\'t "understand where they were from… they never lived in estates".', '"They did not know what that life was like. And as a result, they didn\'t talk to those journalists," she says.', '"But they would talk to us. They recognised us in terms of the way we looked, the way we dress, the way we spoke, the way we approached people and the way we told that story was very different."
