', '"It\'s a challenge", Ms Gordon told the BBC. "For us, it\'s a bit of a double whammy. ', '"We\'re dealing with our own bills and the escalation of that, but we\'re also dealing with the fact that most of our audiences are experiencing the same problem domestically.', '"The ticketing income we rely on to cover those bills, staff wages, to keep us afloat are taking a knock as well. We\'re getting it from both sides."', 'With 80% of its income coming from ticket sales and bar sales, Ms Gordon said the theatre was having to look at "innovative ways" to generate money.', '"Customers are in that position, as are so many people, where they are having to really, really decide what they are going to spend, so are theatre tickets a luxury?" she said. ', 'But she said for many people they were "absolutely essential".', '"That escapism, that chance to have fun with family and friends is absolutely vital," she said.', '"All we can do is create the best experience and price things right so people can build in a theatre trip as part of their monthly budget, but we don\'t underestimate what a big ask that is for everyone at that moment."', '<i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">Find BBC News: East of England on </i><a href="https://www.facebook.com/bbcnewseast/" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Facebook</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">, </i><a href="https://www.instagram.com/bbceastofengland/" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Instagram</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2"> and </i><a href="https://twitter.com/bbclookeast" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Twitter</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">.
