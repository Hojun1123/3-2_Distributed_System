One would be typically the Romans against maybe the Celts. ', '"You\'d have a scenario that\'s seeing those two play-off against each other and most of the rule sets have a points base.', '"The Roman is a very good soldier so he\'d be worth quite a few points whereas the Celts are not quite as skilled so they\'d be worth lower. ', '"So when it comes to the actual battle you have a lot more Celts on the table than you would Romans."', '<i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">Follow BBC West on </i><a href="https://www.facebook.com/pointswest" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Facebook</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">, </i><a href="https://twitter.com/bbcbristol" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Twitter</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2"> and </i><a href="https://www.instagram.com/bbcwest" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Instagram</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">.
