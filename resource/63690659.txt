', 'The two-day show would see the event taken to a "new and even more exciting level in our region", he added.', '"We\'ve done the maths and our decision to make the Gillingham and Shaftesbury Show a two-day event will help us make it more cost effective and even more financially viable by spreading the running costs over two days," Mr Simpson said. ', 'The show will run on 16 and 17 August 2023.', '<i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">Follow BBC South on </i><a href="https://www.facebook.com/bbcsouthnews/" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Facebook</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">, </i><a href="https://twitter.com/bbcsouthnews" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Twitter</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">, or </i><a href="https://www.instagram.com/bbcsouthnews" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Instagram</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">.
