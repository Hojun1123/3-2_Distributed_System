The UK gets less than 5% of its gas from Russia but its gas prices are affected by fluctuations in the global markets.', "While Russian oil and gas exports aren't directly affected by Western sanctions, the prospect of further action by the US and EU is hitting Russian trade and pushing up gas prices globally.", 'The <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-60125659" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">sanctions already imposed</a> by Western nations are designed to stop Russia\'s banks from doing business in several major economies and trade areas.

It does have the power to impose emergency measures, such as ordering big industrial customers to temporarily stop using gas.', "Even before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the market was in crisis.", 'Colder winters in 2021 put pressure on supplies and depleted gas reserves.', 'Those reserves would normally have been replenished in summer months but output dropped as some producers used this time to for maintenance postponed during Covid lockdowns.', 'Meanwhile, calm weather reduced the amount of electricity generated by wind power. As a result, wholesale gas prices more than quadrupled last year.', "The UK has been especially badly-hit as it is one of Europe's biggest users of natural gas - 85% of homes use gas central heating, while gas also generates a third of the UK's electricity.
