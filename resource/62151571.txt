', 'Scarborough Council has set conditions for the approval of the plans, which include a clause that there will be no loss of trees or hedgerows, while also noting that less than 2% of the land is classed as "best and most suitable" for agricultural purposes.', 'A council reports said: "The most dominant feature of the development would be the solar panels which would be repeated in rows or arrays, individually up to 380m in length.', '"It is the intention that the solar panels and associated equipment would be "temporary", remaining in situ for 35 years following the site becoming operational", the report added.', 'The electricity would be fed into the national grid rather than providing power directly to local homes and businesses.', '<i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">Follow BBC Yorkshire on </i><a href="https://www.facebook.com/BBCYorkshire/" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Facebook</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">, </i><a href="https://twitter.com/bbclooknorth" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Twitter</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2"> and </i><a href="https://www.instagram.com/bbcyorkshire/" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Instagram</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">.
