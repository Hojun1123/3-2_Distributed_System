Ensure cables aren\'t frayed or wires exposed and always register a second-hand product when you get it home," said Martyn Allen, technical director of Electrical Safety First.', '"Second-hand goods can be great for saving money and better for the environment but no purchase should ever leave you at risk."', 'World Cup winner Jürgen Klinsmann invites you to subscribe to his daily World Cup newsletter.', '© 2022 BBC.
