', 'Every month in countries like the US and UK, the government releases a new figure estimating how much prices are rising overall.

In many other parts of the world, such as Europe, the problem stems from more recent issues, like the war in Ukraine.', 'To come up with an inflation figure, government statisticians track the prices of thousands of everyday items. This is known as the "basket of goods".', 'The basket is updated regularly to reflect changes in what people are buying and differs depending on the country. ', "For example, in the US, healthcare prices form a much bigger part of the overall calculation than in the UK, where medical bills tend to be a smaller part of people's expenses. By contrast, alcohol prices are weighted more heavily in the UK.", "Each month's inflation figure shows how much these prices have risen since the year before. This is known as the Consumer Price Index (CPI).  ", "Pay increases haven't kept up with prices, even in countries like the US, where a hot labour market has pushed companies to increase wages.", 'When inflation is taken into account, the average hourly wage in the US was actually 2.8% lower in August than 12 months earlier.

They are looking for a wider slowdown in price increases.', 'Higher interest rates make it more expensive for businesses and households to borrow, which reduces demand and should, in theory, help to ease the pressures pushing up prices.', 'However, when inflation is caused by things like rising energy prices worldwide, some worry interest rate rises have more limited power.', 'There are few easy answers for politicians. Economists say price caps, which some countries have implemented, only make the underlying problem worse by subsidising demand.
