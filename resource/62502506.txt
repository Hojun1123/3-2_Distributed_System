"You might find that people go, \'It made me feel comfortable, it made me feel safe, it made me feel as though I was able to do this work.\'"', 'Specialist intimacy co-ordinators were "the most fantastic" additions to sets, according to the English actress, who recently played a widow in search of sexual fulfilment in the movie Good Luck To You, Leo Grande.', '"And no, you can\'t just let it flow," she said.

"It was a joy. We had a good chemistry between us, and we knew what we were doing was unusual. Because she was married, I was married.', '"But we were following the story.

It\'s like a stunt. Our job as actors is to make it not look technical. Nobody wants an impromptu grope."', 'In the same interview, Bean said he had been sad to see a scene with Snowpiercer co-star Lena Hall, which he said was "trying to push the boundaries", be "censored" after it was cut from the final edit, and that she "had a musical cabaret background, so she was up for anything".', 'This video can not be played', 'Intimacy director advises BBC drama about shooting sex scenes', 'In response, Hall, who made it clear she had felt entirely at ease acting alongside Bean, <a href="https://twitter.com/LenaRockerHall/status/1556736826278400007" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">said</a>: "Just because I am in theatre (not cabaret, but I do perform them every once in a while) does not mean that I am up for anything.', '"If I feel comfortable with my scene partner and with others in the room then I won\'t need an intimacy co-ordinator.
