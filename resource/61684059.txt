In an email to staff, seen by the news wire Reuters, Tesla chief executive Elon Musk said he had a "super bad feeling" about the economy.', 'Sentiment for both consumers and the financial markets have slipped recently.', 'Data shows that the annual rate of US inflation hit 8.3% in the year to April, which is a slight drop from the level recorded for March but is the highest rate since 1981.', 'Analysts said the job growth in May remained solid, if slower, than over the last year.', '"Part of the slowing in payrolls in recent months likely is a knee-jerk reaction to higher costs due to the surge in energy prices triggered by the war in Ukraine," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics.
