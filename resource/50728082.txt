It's a business known as cloud computing and it has only been around 10 or 15 years.", "Its rapid expansion means AWS supplied 70% of Amazon's profits in its most recent quarter.", 'In an interview with the BBC, Mr Jassy explained that the division began with start-ups such as Airbnb, Deliveroo and Pinterest, who built their businesses from scratch on top of AWS, but that in recent years more established firms have joined them.', 'Despite that success, the business is facing some real tests - not least fierce competition from Microsoft.', 'A big blow hit in October, when the US government awarded a juicy $10bn (£7.6bn) contract from the Department of Defense (DoD) to Microsoft.', "Amazon's AWS had been expected to win the Joint Enterprise Infrastructure (Jedi) project. It is challenging the decision, saying there had been interference from the White House. ", 'In a document made public in December, AWS explained why it was protesting against the Jedi contract award. "The question is whether the president of the United States should be allowed to use the budget of DoD to pursue his own personal and political ends," the filing stated.', '"DoD\'s substantial and pervasive errors are hard to understand, and impossible to assess separate and apart from the president\'s repeatedly expressed determination to, in the words of the president himself, \'screw Amazon\'. ', 'Speaking to the BBC at the annual AWS event in Las Vegas, Mr Jassy said the decision was dangerous, as Amazon had "the best possible technology infrastructure platform".', 'Mr Jassy also said it was a "very dangerous" precedent if government was not going to base decisions on "objective valuations".', 'When asked whether the Jedi debacle would change the way AWS would deal with the government in the future - Mr Jassy said it would not.

It seems unlikely as President Trump <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-50717564" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">has made his dislike</a> of Amazon clear.

', 'Rival Google has limited its use of facial recognition to celebrity face matching, and the chief executive of its cloud business, Thomas Kurian, told the BBC that it had not offered more powerful services like Rekognition because in some countries it is not legally allowed.', 'Mr Jassy said that there is confusion because of the lack of regulation at a federal government level.', '"If you don\'t have a federal government actually regulating something that people are debating, then you end up with 50 different rules in 50 different states and even more potentially in municipalities," he said.', 'Mr Jassy suggested that facial recognition had been used for a lot of good.', '"It has reunited missing kids with their parents, it\'s found human trafficking, it\'s improved security and identity, there are all kinds of ways that it is adding real value to society," Mr Jassy said.', 'The AWS chief executive also said that in the nearly three years it has had facial recognition technology, it has had zero reports of misuse by law enforcement agencies.', "Mr Jassy said AWS has provided very firm guidance to law enforcement agencies that if they're going to use facial recognition, they should only use predictions that come back with a 99% confidence level or higher, and even then only as one piece of evidence in a human-driven investigation.", '"We provide free training for law enforcement on how to use facial recognition technology, and if we find we have any kind of reported misuse, which we haven\'t had yet, we would suspend their ability not just to use the service but also the platform," said Mr Jassy.', '"But I can understand why people may want stronger assurances that it can\'t happen.

And then also be able to invest very substantially in renewable energy and other inventions in those areas at a faster rate," Mr Jassy said.  ', '© 2022 BBC.
