', 'While deepfakes allow troublemakers to directly spread disinformation, their appearance more widely on online platforms is causing a climate of information uncertainty - which is open to further manipulation. ', 'For example, genuine footage could be dismissed as deepfakes by those seeking to avoid accountability. ', 'This makes the challenge for citizens to recognise genuine content, and for regulators and platforms to take action on them, ever more difficult. ', '"You have this kind of double-edged sword - anything can be faked and everything can be denied," Ms Schick says. ', 'In recent years, Big Tech companies have made efforts to detect and counter deepfakes on their platforms - with Meta and Microsoft among stakeholders launching the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/deepfake-detection-challenge" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Deepfake Detection Challenge</a> for AI researchers in 2019.

', '"They aren\'t the most prevalent or malicious forms of disinformation; we have so many existing forms of disinformation that are already doing more harm."', 'Under the revised EU code, accounts taking part in co-ordinated inauthentic behaviour, generating fake engagement, impersonation and bot-driven amplification will also need to be periodically reviewed by relevant tech firms.

', '"This technology will become more and more prevalent relatively quickly, so we need to be on the front foot," she says.
