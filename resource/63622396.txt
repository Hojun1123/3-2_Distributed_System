One of the charities Sinfield's team are supporting is the My Name'5 Doddie Foundation.", 'Speaking ahead of day two, Sinfield said: "I think when we started at Murrayfield yesterday, the people who came out were incredible, there were people scattered all along the route in different villages.

', '"Thankfully somebody is looking down on us today, but it\'s been brilliant". ', 'Many people came out to support the team, including Fiona Shepherd, who has known Weir since childhood. ', '"Doddie was a family friend, I was friendly with his sister-in-law and have been involved with a lot of his fundraising in the Borders. ', '"My brother has just been diagnosed with a very similar illness, it has devastated us," she added.
