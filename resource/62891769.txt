Google is the largest, and most important, ad tech vendor - with a market share reaching over 90%.', 'Selling digital advertising space has become a valuable source of income for publishers including global news websites, as well as smaller operators, such as independent bloggers - all of whom agree to carry advertising on their sites for a fee.', "The European Commission and its UK equivalent are investigating whether Google's dominance in the ad tech business gives it an unfair advantage over rivals and advertisers.", 'The French competition watchdog imposed a €220m fine on the company last year.
