', 'Once these have been sent, they will then blackmail the victim by threatening to release the images or video to their family, friends or on other online platforms such as YouTube, if they do not pay them in money or gift cards.', 'Det Insp Cheryl Godwin said: "If you have found yourself in this situation please try not to panic - stop all communication with the person and if you are being asked for money, do not pay them.', '"Instead screen capture any evidence where you can and contact police.', '"These offenders exploit the vulnerability of children - and we would urge parents and carers to remind children that control is lost as soon as an explicit image is sent to anyone, and many images inevitably end up being shared and spread online."', '<i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">Follow BBC West on </i><a href="https://www.facebook.com/pointswest" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Facebook</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">, </i><a href="https://twitter.com/bbcbristol" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Twitter</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2"> and </i><a href="https://www.instagram.com/bbcwest" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Instagram</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">.
