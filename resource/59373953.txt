It\'s also a huge opportunity for UK companies to show their engineering skills, powers of innovation and ability to compete on a global scale.', '"Decommissioning is also a key part of the UK\'s transition to low-carbon energy and its aim of reaching net zero by 2050. This is partly because the installations being removed tend to be older and so generate more emissions relative to the oil and gas they produce.
