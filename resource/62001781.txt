', '"At its worst, staffing was 40% down," she said. "The babies didn\'t stop coming during Covid but services did have to be rationalised."', 'Dr Tyler, who said the pandemic "ended up pitting midwives against women", criticised "confusing... contradictory" advice from the government and NHS England that "kept changing".', 'Three mothers have spoken to the BBC about their experience.', '<b class="ssrcss-hmf8ql-BoldText e5tfeyi3">Phillippa Guillou</b> was left with post-traumatic stress disorder, suffering flashbacks and nightmares, after the birth of her daughter Arabella in July 2020.', "She said she was left alone and in fear for hours as she struggled through labour at Queen Charlotte's in Hammersmith, where her husband Ollie was not allowed to be by her side.

"I genuinely believed I was going to die because it had been such a long time on my own. ', '"Labour feels like it\'s never-ending and after six hours I\'d got myself into such a state I had an epidural."', 'Arabella was immediately taken away to intensive care for resuscitation, while Ollie was sent home and Philippa was left alone in a room for 16 hours.', '"I couldn\'t get to her," she said. "I just felt totally abandoned... you would press the buzzer and nobody would come.', '"My baby was crying and I couldn\'t reach her because I was too beat up and still recovering."', 'Phillippa was in hospital for a week without the help she needed, something she said was "a nightmare" when her baby had an undiagnosed severe tongue tie that made breastfeeding impossible for the first few months.', '"Women shouldn\'t have been on their own," she said. "It\'s totally cruel to think someone shouldn\'t have someone with them." ', 'The absence of a partner is not just about comfort, Phillippa said, but has a direct impact on the health and wellbeing of the parents.', '"My birth didn\'t go well because I was so stressed and scared and anxious on my own," she said.

"There were no midwives available to help with anything because they were so busy.', '"Margot had jaundice and was on a strict feeding schedule so I was having to express milk, sterilise bottles and feed her all the time when I was just exhausted."', 'Father Alisdair couldn\'t be with his wife and child for seven nights, barring a brief visit on the intensive care ward, although Sophie said he was "lucky" to have been able to be there for the birth itself.', '"I know a lot of people missed the birth, especially if it was sudden," she said. "I felt quite bad for Alisdair though, as he was supposed to be on paternity leave but just had to go back to work and he was by himself too.', '"It would have been nice for them to make allowances for those who had to stay more than 24 hours."', 'Another mum, <b class="ssrcss-hmf8ql-BoldText e5tfeyi3">Nicola</b>, spent five hours in labour without any pain relief in A&amp;E at Queen Charlotte in Hammersmith before being told a bed could not be found.', 'She was only able to text her husband the news as he had to wait in the car park. At first he thought she must have misunderstood due to "going a bit loopy in labour".', "When they were told they must go to St Mary's in Paddington, they drove off but had no idea what to do when they got there and could not find a car park. ", '"We literally abandoned the car in the middle of the road with the doors open," she said. "That was the level of panic.', '"We finally found where we were supposed to be going and they said, \'we\'re not expecting you\', and I flipped because at this point I\'d been in labour for 10 hours."', 'Although the midwife who supported Nicola through the birth was "absolutely brilliant", she said the aftercare was "just horrendous".', '"I had quite a traumatic birth and needed a couple of hours of surgery after the baby was born," she said.', '"My husband was just handed the baby and told to wait for me and then we only had an hour together before he was told to leave again.', '"That night was probably the worst night of my life... I felt totally abandoned."', 'Having had an epidural and being unable to walk, Nicola was wheeled up to a dark ward and left alone with a newborn baby and "no idea what I was supposed to do".', 'Unable to get out of bed, she pushed the buzzer for assistance when her baby started crying and was confronted by a "really angry" nurse.', '"She reluctantly changed her nappy and put her clothes on," she said.
