['<b class="ssrcss-hmf8ql-BoldText e5tfeyi3">Elon Musk\'s SpaceX company has been launching thousands of satellites into orbit.

", 'Starlink provides internet services via a huge network of satellites. ', 'It is aimed at people who live in remote areas who cannot get high-speed internet.', '"There are people in the UK in that category, but more across the world, in places like Africa," says Dr Lucinda King, Space Projects Manager at the University of Portsmouth.', "Starlink's satellites have been put in low-level orbit around the Earth to make connection speeds between the satellites and the ground as fast as possible.", 'However, a great many low-level satellites are needed to provide full coverage of the globe. ', "It's thought Starlink has put some 3,000 of them into space since 2018. It may eventually use 10,000 or 12,000, says Chris Hall, editorial director of the technology website Pocket Lint.", '"Using satellites solves the problem of getting internet connections to remote locations in deserts and mountains," he says.', '"It bypasses the need to build massive amounts of infrastructure, like cables and masts, to reach those areas."   ', "Compared to standard internet providers, Starlink isn't cheap. ", 'It charges customers $99 per month (£89 per month in the UK).
