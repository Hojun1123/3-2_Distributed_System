', '"Sadly many of our viewers will be able to relate to Lola\'s story, and it\'s been heart-breaking to speak to the families affected by brain tumours and hear their stories."', 'Mr Adams said one in three people know of someone with a brain tumour, so they were "not that rare".', '"Working with people like EastEnders really has an impact for our community to recognise that people care and are interested," he said.', '"We are bringing to more people the indiscriminate nature of the disease. It\'s not about ageing or lifestyle, that\'s why it\'s the biggest cancer killer of children and adults under 40."', 'Mr Adams said the team at EastEnders approached the charity as they wanted the storyline to have "integrity and authenticity".', 'He said since the storyline began there had been "huge traffic" on the charity\'s social media channels and he hoped it would encourage more research.', '"People can\'t support a cause unless they know it exists," Mr Adams said.', 'He added that more investment was needed in "science and cures" to improve the prognosis for people with brain tumours.', '<i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">Find BBC News: East of England on </i><a href="https://www.facebook.com/bbcnewseast/" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Facebook</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">, </i><a href="https://www.instagram.com/bbceastofengland/" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Instagram</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2"> and </i><a href="https://twitter.com/bbclookeast" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Twitter</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">.
