This time, Republicans have also nominated a black candidate, Herschel Walker, 60. ", "The two men both come from humble roots, but the paths they've taken - and their politics today - could not be more different. Senator Warnock is a Baptist preacher who rose to prominence as the senior pastor at Martin Luther King Jr's church. Mr Walker is an American football legend who was lured into the race by his old friend Donald Trump.  ", "Walker's campaign has been plagued by a series of personal scandals - yet conservative voters appear to like his plea for redemption and his rejection of liberal policies. ", 'Warnock hopes his campaign to protect abortion and voting rights will inspire liberals - but high inflation, a slowing economy and the unpopularity of President Joe Biden threaten his tenuous hold on this seat.

The last two presidential elections were each decided by barely 1% - and this Senate race could also come down to the wire. ', "Perhaps that's why it's got so personal. Or maybe it's because of the larger-than-life characters. ", 'John Fetterman, 53, is the 6ft 8in (2m), Harvard-graduate-turned-small-town mayor who usually dresses in shorts and a hoodie. The progressive Democrat had a commanding lead until he suffered a stroke a few months ago that required him to use closed captioning technology to answer questions. ', 'His Republican opponent, Mehmet Oz - best known to TV viewers as "Dr Oz" from the Oprah Winfrey Show - has capitalised, repeatedly challenging him to public debates and even suggesting Mr Fetterman would not be ill if he "had ever eaten a vegetable in his life".', 'In return, the Fetterman campaign has trolled the celebrity heart surgeon on social media as a carpetbagger from New Jersey, a peddler of disproven miracle cures and even a puppy killer.', "Strap in for more election drama in this campaign's final stretch.", '<i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">If Latino voters really are deserting the Democrats, this is where we\'ll find out</i>', 'This is another race that experts are calling a "toss up" because it\'s too close to call right now.

Now she's viewed as the most at-risk candidate this year - and Latino voters may help sink her bid for re-election.", "Democrats have been losing ground with Latinos in recent years - in part because many prefer conservative policies on abortion and immigration. But it's the struggling economy - the most important issue for every demographic - which is most damaging. Nevada, which relies so much on the riches generated in Las Vegas and Reno, was particularly hard hit by the pandemic. ", "Republicans are hoping voters punish the party in power. If they do, then Adam Laxalt, 44, could follow in the footsteps of his father and grandfather who both served in the Senate.
