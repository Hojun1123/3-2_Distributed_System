', '"Each one of these algorithms has been given a registration number, so the CAC can focus enforcement efforts on a particular algorithm. The question is, what is the next step to seeing if an algorithm is up to code?"', 'However, Zhai Wei, an executive director at the Competition Law Research Center at the East China University of Political Science and Law, believes the information provided was "much more detailed than what was published for sure".', '"That involves some business secrets, which is not possible to be released to the public," he told Bloomberg.', 'ByteDance declined to comment when approached by the BBC on Tuesday.', 'Alibaba and listed technology firms Tencent, NetEase and Baidu did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment.', '<b class="ssrcss-hmf8ql-BoldText e5tfeyi3">Suranjana Tewari, Asia Business Correspondent</b>', 'This move is ultimately about control.', 'China has the largest base of internet users in the world, and is a massive market for e-commerce, gaming and smartphones. And so, technology companies operating there have expanded exponentially in recent years.

It wants to redirect people's attention to content that the state thinks is fit for public consumption.", 'Beijing has urged service providers to ensure algorithms "actively spread positive energy", and are not used to encourage indulgences, excessive spending and exposure to celebrity culture. ', 'International brands like Google and Facebook have been under pressure to submit this kind of information over concerns about how they use data and curate content, but they have resisted until now, saying that algorithms are business secrets.', 'Chinese regulators have been tightening their grip on the technology sector for nearly two years now. ', 'The country adopted new rules for algorithms in March - which allow users to opt out of contributing to recommendations.', 'It also required algorithms with "public opinion properties or social mobilisation capabilities" to register with the CAC.', 'Ms Schaefer said it was "remarkable" that the registrations were made public.', '"I\'m not aware of any other country in the world where you can go see a list of all of the pieces of code that are essentially informing the decisions that you make, the purchasing decisions that you make, the content viewing decisions that you make," she said.', 'This video can not be played', 'Watch: Beijing cracks down on tech with new data rules ', 'World Cup winner Jürgen Klinsmann invites you to subscribe to his daily World Cup newsletter.', '© 2022 BBC.
