', 'The BBC understands it is unlikely all the images will be released, although it is possible some will be published to illustrate the nature of the gatherings.', 'Asked on BBC One\'s Sunday Morning programme whether all the evidence gathered by Ms Gray would be included in her report, Mr Zahawi replied: "I would absolutely welcome it. It\'s the right thing to do."', 'He said the prime minister had his "full confidence", telling host Jo Coburn: "Sue Gray makes that decision [over what to include in her report].

', 'But Mr Zahawi said: "The prime minister would never interfere in the outcome of the investigation."', '"The prime minister, throughout the process, has allowed Sue Gray to conduct herself independently," he added.', 'Downing Street said Mr Johnson had been "clear throughout" that the report should be "completely independent", and its findings had not been discussed.', "There hasn't been a renewed clamour among Conservative MPs for the prime minister to go, now that police have confirmed the scale of the fines imposed on officials and politicians in Downing Street.", "But Boris Johnson's long-standing critics will pore over the Sue Gray report to assess whether his initial assertion that Covid guidance and rules were followed was credible. ", "The devil for Mr Johnson will be in the as-yet-unseen detail of the Downing Street gatherings. If, for example, she were to provide descriptions - or even possibly, in some cases, images - of events that weren't socially distanced, that could potentially inflict more damage on the prime minister. ", 'But if Mr Johnson, in the statement he will make to MPs when the report becomes public, can convince colleagues he was the victim of bad advice from his officials, then his next challenge will come in June. ', "That's when voters will get a chance to have their say in two crucial by-elections in Conservative held seats.", 'For Labour, shadow Treasury minister Pat McFadden told Sky News: "I\'ve got every faith in Sue Gray\'s integrity and she is a civil servant of the highest integrity.', '"We don\'t know the details of that meeting, it\'s not clear who called it, there\'s different accounts of that, so it\'s hard for me to say what was said there."', 'An interim version of Ms Gray\'s report, published in January, did not name individuals but <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-60195620" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">criticised "failures of leadership and judgement"</a> and said some events should not have "been allowed to take place".', 'The publication of her full findings was delayed when the Met Police launched its own investigation.', "The prime minister faces a further inquiry by the Commons' Privileges Committee about whether he knowingly lied to Parliament when he previously told MPs that no laws had been broken in Downing Street.", 'Under government guidelines, ministers who knowingly mislead the House of Commons are expected to resign.', 'World Cup winner Jürgen Klinsmann invites you to subscribe to his daily World Cup newsletter.', '© 2022 BBC.
