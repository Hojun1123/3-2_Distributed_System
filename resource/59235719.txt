It will be ITM\'s second such site in the UK.', 'The company said the plant would be operational by the end of 2023, subject to planning consent.', 'ITM and the university have also agreed to plan and fund a National Hydrogen Research, Innovation and Skills centre.', 'The factory will manufacture electrolysers that split water into molecules of hydrogen and oxygen using renewable power.', '"The resultant zero-carbon green hydrogen can then be used to decarbonise industrial processes, transport and heating, and will play a major role in achieving net zero," the university said.', 'The research centre will be adjacent to the planned factory and will, the company said, lead to the creation of new jobs at all levels of the hydrogen sector as well as offering training and career development.', 'It will also promote the use of hydrogen, both domestically and internationally.', 'Dr Graham Cooley, chief executive of ITM Power, said both initiatives would "support the local economy through job creation and supply chain support".
