They do not reflect the views of Concertworks," said the company\'s lawyer, Aaron Kernaghan.', 'The company has been in touch with concertgoers who raised concerns, and has issued an apology to its audience, performers and the Perth Concert Hall. ', 'In the meantime, it has "chosen to discontinue its relationship with Mr Lazenby" and has commenced  "a thorough review of the matter", Mr Kernaghan added.', 'According to one audience member, Lazenby spent Saturday\'s interview "talking about basically his sexual conquests".', '"He was homophobic, he swore, he certainly wasn\'t talking about his Bond movies," <a href="https://www.6pr.com.au/creepy-homophobic-horrific-george-lazenby-waso-performance-shocks-audience/" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">she told Perth radio station 6PR</a>. "He downplayed the Queen a day after she died," she added.', '"It was absolutely unbelievable… At one point he named an Australian cricketer whose daughter he was chasing, and he said he dragged the daughter out of a pub and put her in a car in London, which again is of course horrific.', '"It wasn\'t even charming, it wasn\'t even funny. It was creepy, it was offensive... He was disgusting, there\'s no two ways about it."', 'Another attendee described the interview as the "self-interested misogynistic stories of George Lazenby\'s sexual prowess, intimate details of diarrhoea and objectification of women."', '"It wasn\'t until a brave member of the public shouted, \'Excuse me, this is offensive\', that the tension was released and George was jeered off stage and music saved the day," <a href="https://thewest.com.au/news/wa/george-lazenby-issues-half-hearted-apology-over-perth-concert-remarks-that-may-have-offended-some-people-c-8213340" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">they told The West Australian newspaper</a>.', 'Concertgoer Joseph McCormack <a href="https://twitter.com/Joe_McCormack/status/1569288990439936000" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">said on Twitter</a> that at least one audience member "called out the offence that Lazenby was causing" during the show.', 'A second caller to 6PR defended the actor, saying his stories were a deliberate "exaggeration" for comedic effect.', '"He didn\'t kidnap [anyone], there was no rape. People were just getting so woke. [The show] was very entertaining until people were yelling out and booing."', "The BBC has not been able to independently verify the nature of Lazenby's comments.", 'The West Australian Symphony Orchestra (WASO), who also performed at the show, distanced themselves from the actor in a statement released this weekend.', '"His recollections were personal views that may have reflected a time where such behaviour was tolerated, but has never been acceptable," the orchestra wrote.', '"His comments were his own and do not reflect our society today. His views are not shared or endorsed by WASO or Perth Concert Hall."', 'Australia\'s culture minister David Templeman added: "I understand that the audience made their views clear about the content and good on them.

I will never play him again. Peace - that\'s the message now," he said at the time.', '<b class="ssrcss-hmf8ql-BoldText e5tfeyi3">Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that Concertworks had contacted concertgoers to issue a refund. </b>', '<i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">Follow us on </i><a href="https://www.facebook.com/BBCEntsNews/" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Facebook</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">, or on Twitter </i><a href="https://twitter.com/BBCNewsEnts" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">@BBCNewsEnts</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">.
