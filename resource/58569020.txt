', 'These were Countryside and Taylor Wimpey, for using "possibly unfair contract terms", and Barratt Developments and Persimmon Homes over the possible mis-selling of leasehold homes. The watchdog\'s investigation into Barratt Developments and Taylor Wimpey is continuing.', 'Andrea Coscelli, chief executive of the CMA, said Countryside leaseholders could breathe a "sigh of relief", following the contract changes.', '"No one should feel like a prisoner in their home, trapped by terms that mean they can struggle to sell or mortgage their property," he said.', '"We will continue to robustly tackle developers and investors - as we have done over the past two years - to make sure that people aren\'t taken advantage of."', 'Some of the biggest names in property have changed their terms recently, while others remain under investigation.

A leasehold house can also be difficult to sell.', 'There were an estimated 4.6 million leasehold dwellings in England between 2019 and 2020, which equated to 19% of the English housing stock. More than two thirds (3.2 million) of the leasehold dwellings were flats and 1.5 million were houses, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/leasehold-dwellings-2019-to-2020/leasehold-dwellings-2019-to-2020" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">official figures said.</a>', 'Katie Kendrick, founder of the National Leasehold Campaign (NLC), said the changes would help people "escape onerous ground rents that make their homes unmortgageable and unsellable".', '"We are delighted that Countryside are the next domino to fall in this whole sorry saga of doubling ground rents," she added.', 'Countryside Properties confirmed it no longer sells leasehold homes with doubling ground rents. It will also remove terms which converted clauses which meant ground rent increased in line with the Retail Prices Index (RPI).

"We could not really sell [the homes] because mortgage companies found these increased terms unacceptable."', 'Mr Jafar said when he and others raised the issue with Countryside, the company said rising ground rent payments were "industry standard".', '"The whole thing stank from the beginning," said Mr Jafar. "Countryside say they are really happy to come to a solution for leaseholders. People are only affected because Countryside wrote these leases in the first place.', '"I\'m disappointed that they [Countryside] have not given any admission of liability. I do not think they should be given any credit for what they are doing."', 'Dr Coscelli said Taylor Wimpey and freehold investors had the "opportunity to do the right thing" to remove "problematic clauses from their contracts".', '"If they refuse, we stand ready to step in and take further action - through the courts, if necessary," he said.', 'NCL co-founder Jo Darbyshire, who lives in a Taylor Wimpey house that was sold in 2010 with ground rent of £295, doubling every 10 years, said it was "about time" for the housebuilder to "do the right thing and match what Countryside are doing".', 'Taylor Wimpey declined to comment when contacted by the BBC.', 'Housing secretary Robert Jenrick said said new legislation would "put an end to this practice" by housebuilders for future homeowners, by setting ground rents in new leases at zero.', 'Ground rents typically start at about £250 a year. Doubling clauses mean that this amount escalates over time. Campaigners often say the leasehold system was not properly explained to them when they bought their properties, leaving them trapped in unsellable homes.', 'Three firms have now agreed to change their ways, but the CMA is continuing to investigate the use of ground rent by Taylor Wimpey and Barratt Homes. The government is introducing new legislation to scrap ground rent on new leases, but homeowners who have already paid high charges in the past want compensation. ', 'For the four million leaseholders across England and Wales, ground rent is only part of the problem. They do not own a single brick of the building, so they need permission to do any work on the property and can be charged a fee for it.
