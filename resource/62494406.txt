We contact these customers on an individual basis to advise of any changes.\'', 'Octopus Energy said it constantly review direct debits to make sure its customers were paying an "appropriate amount" for the energy they use. However, it said it "wouldn\'t suggest any changes based on the price cap until the new price cap has come into effect".', '"Even if we do suggest Direct Debit changes - our customers are always completely in control and can get in touch to change them anytime," it added.
