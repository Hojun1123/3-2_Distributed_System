If 75% of voters are in favour of the takeover, another vote will follow on whether the business is fully transferred to Bain Capital, or if the US firm can carry out business under the LV= brand.', 'But politicians from several parties and some LV= members have raised concerns about selling the company to a US private equity firm, as well as the size of the payout due to members if the deal goes through.', 'Mr Hartigan told the BBC\'s Today programme: "It\'s the only bid that safeguards the LV brand that our members loved."', 'The company started out as the Liverpool Independent Legal Victorian Burial Society in 1843.

Nor would he share the details of other bids - the transparency politicians and other commentators say is needed if they are to duly evaluate the merits of this sale or the motivations of Bain Capital. That's not to say it won't be intent on reinvigorating the brand  - but he may not have won over the sceptics.
