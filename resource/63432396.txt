', 'In conclusion, the report suggested a number of further actions to improve access to higher education for disadvantaged students.', 'It said there needed to be a more-targeted approach to help lower-income and disabled students into higher education and to help them while they studied.', 'It also said there was a need for "a more robust evidence base" on what strategies worked in Northern Ireland and a need to increase access to HE for some students in rural areas.', 'Â© 2022 BBC.
