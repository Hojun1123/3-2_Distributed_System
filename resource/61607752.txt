', '"They continue to treat her for pretty horrible things that she has going on, but we\'re getting somewhere. We\'re okay and she\'s home and she\'s doing good."', 'Blair says he strives to be a role model for Erin and his step-daughters and thinks that spending so much time in hospital with his daughter means he\'s "a better paramedic for it".', "But it doesn't make his job any easier.", '"I think dealing with people\'s families is the hardest thing, to be honest," he says.', '"Some situations are heart-breaking because sometimes we know that it\'s kind of futile and they\'re not going to survive. ', '"I\'ve always found it difficult to deal with sick children but I think even now, being a dad whose had a kid in intensive care, it still terrifies me. It\'s horrible."', 'Blair remains upbeat as he talks about his job despite the strains, both at home and at work, in the last two years and says that is because it can be so rewarding.', 'He says: "I do love my job. ', '"We get some good times and unfortunately some bad things with some patients. But if I can walk away at the end of my shift and feel like I know someone\'s life is better because I\'ve intervened, then I go home happy.', '"I recently attended a job with a woman who had a heart attack and I didn\'t think she would survive, but last week she was in the station bringing me some biscuits and it was really nice to know she is going about her daily life because I intervened and helped her in that situation."', 'The Scottish Ambulance Service <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-60906676" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">recruited a record number of frontline A&amp;E staff last year</a> in a bid to cope with the pressures of the pandemic.
