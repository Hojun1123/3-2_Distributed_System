', 'Newsbeat has seen emails from Ticketmaster to Harriet in which the company writes about processing the refund.', 'But they have not responded to a request for comment on the issue of refunds.', 'Daniel, from Durham, has also been having issues with Ticketmaster, but unlike Harriet, he has not received a refund - which he calls "really unfair".', "The 30-year-old has two tickets worth £260 each, which he did consider selling but he was not getting the sale price for them, meaning he'd lose money.", 'He says he was told by Ticketmaster they would offer a refund, but was then sent another email - seen by Newsbeat - saying he would not be getting a refund because he bought the tickets through a payment plan.', '"I tried to press them more, asking questions about it. And they\'ve now just stopped responding to me," he says.', '"They have not done their part in terms of the event and actually providing customer service to deal with these problems. So it\'s just really frustrating overall."', 'Harriet, though, is now satisfied having received her money.', '"The issue is that we\'ve had problems with them before. They\'re so hard to get hold of, they have these generic responses. It\'s unfair," she says.', 'Leeds and Reading organisers said they were "saddened to hear that Jack Harlow and Måneskin have decided to perform at an award show the same weekend they were confirmed to play Reading and Leeds".', 'The 1975 were previously announced as replacements for Rage Against The Machine.', 'And on Thursday, festival bosses said Charli XCX and AJ Tracey were replacing Måneskin and Jack Harlow on the line-up.', '<i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">Follow Newsbeat on </i><a href="https://www.instagram.com/bbcnewsbeat/" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Instagram</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">, </i><a href="https://www.facebook.com/bbcnewsbeat/" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Facebook</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">, </i><a href="https://twitter.com/BBCNewsbeat" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Twitter</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2"> and </i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe1Ef-K5jpnRsmVY5hCBhOw" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">YouTube</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">.</i>', '<i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">Listen to Newsbeat </i><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/live:bbc_radio_one" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">live</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2"> at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back </i><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006wkry/episodes/player" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">here</a>.
