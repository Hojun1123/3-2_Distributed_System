', 'Applications have to be made by bodies such as universities, further education colleges and schools. If they are successful, these bodies can invite their own students to apply for individual funding.', 'The Turing scheme will provide placements across the world. ', 'Erasmus covers placements across the EU and some non-EU countries that pay to be part of the scheme.

', 'For example, a university student going to France for six months would get £335 (€390) per month under the Turing scheme, while the Erasmus scheme paid £317 (€370) per month in 2020-21.', 'UK students did not have to pay tuition fees when studying abroad under Erasmus because the scheme was reciprocal - it allowed EU students to come and study in the UK as well.', 'The Turing scheme will not pay tuition fees for UK students studying abroad or for students from other countries studying in the UK. Instead, it expects the fees to be waived by the universities that take part.  ', 'Universities Minister Michelle Donelan told the Today programme "The way it\'ll work is our universities will partner with another university and they will waive the fees because they will be exchanging students." ', 'The government has allocated £110m for the first year of the scheme, which starts in 2021/22, but it is not currently funded after that.', 'Both schemes offer support.', 'Erasmus pays an additional £103 (€120) per month - a total of £420 (€490) per month for a poorer student going to France for six months in the current academic year. ', 'The Turing scheme would pay £445\u202f(€519) per month to the same student, but also contribute to travel costs (the amount will depend on how far the student is travelling). ', 'It will also provide poorer applicants with additional expenses, such as the costs of visas, passports, and health insurance. ', 'Again, both Erasmus and Turing offer support.', 'The Turing scheme website says that, unlike Erasmus, it will "cover preparatory visits to carry out risk assessments and ensure participants will be able to equally access and take part in all elements of a placement".
