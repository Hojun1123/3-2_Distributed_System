', 'When defending the proposed 1% increase in March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson described it as "as much as we can at the present time". ', 'However, the government now says: "The economy is actually doing better than we anticipated four months ago".', 'At the start of the year, the International Monetary Fund predicted that the British economy would grow by 4.5% in 2021. Following the vaccine programme and the reopening of businesses, they now expect the UK economy to grow by 5.3% this year.

', 'These pay bodies - made up of individuals not directly attached to the relevant department but with experience in economics and employee relations - work with government departments, unions and other groups to come up with a recommendation on how pay should change each year. ', 'This recommendation is non-binding - meaning ultimately the government decides. ', 'In November 2020, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-55073390" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">the government announced</a> that public-sector workers would have their pay frozen in 2021-22.

', 'It was initially recommended, by the Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC), that pay should rise by just 1% for 2021-22. ', 'The DHSC cited the "uncertain" financial situation and low inflation. It also said anything more than 1% would require "reprioritisation" of the NHS budget.', 'But inflation has risen significantly since March.

', 'Strict pay freezes or pay caps were implemented until 2018-19, when the government removed these limits and a three-year pay agreement was implemented for NHS staff in England. ', 'But the impact of inflation means that over the whole period some salaries are worth less than they were a decade ago.', 'For example, a newly qualified nurse starting in 2020-21 would be earning about 3% less than one who started in 2010-11, once we account for inflation and the impact of pay freezes and caps.', 'Nurses are just one part of the NHS workforce and the pay agreement implemented in 2018-19 affected different staff members in different ways. ', 'For example, the agreement meant the wages of those in the very lowest pay band, such as housekeeping or security staff, increased by almost 30% over the past three years.
