', '"It is unsurprising that children eligible for free school meals were absent more often than their peers during this period. They are more likely to live in urban areas with higher levels of deprivation, places which tended to have the highest Covid rates. ', '"Some children were particularly vulnerable to missing school, having disengaged during lockdown, and absence has also been caused by mental health factors often impacted by the pandemic.', '"Real-terms funding cuts have left fewer pastoral support staff available to intervene and support persistently absent pupils to return to school," Ms Hughes added. ', '"This is one of many reasons why we need to see a substantial increase in investment in education. It is so vital to improving outcomes for children and young people."', 'In the spring, fixed penalty notices were suggested as a "last resort" to tackle worries over continued absenteeism.', 'The Welsh government said the last two years had been "incredibly difficult" for many families and it remained mindful of people\'s concerns. ', '"However it\'s vital for young people\'s wellbeing and education to attend school, seeing their friends, and learning in the classroom," said a spokesperson.', '"We have recently provided almost £4m for family engagement officers, to establish positive relationships with parents and provide support and information on good attendance. Schools that know their families well can ensure that measures are put in place to help children maintain good engagement and attendance. "', 'It said there was also funding for an attendance officer in each local authority to support pupils in year 11 to try to ensure they progressed through their GCSEs.', 'Meanwhile, the most recent figures on school absenteeism for this academic year show there is still a gap between children from poorer backgrounds and other pupils.', 'The attendance rate so far has been higher for pupils not eligible for free school meals (93.1%) than pupils who are eligible (86.9%).', 'In England, persistent absence is defined as missing more than 10% of school. ', 'There, the rate is almost twice as high as before the pandemic.', 'The Welsh government is reviewing the definition of "persistent" absence, which it regards as an important measure because it is often a trigger for intervention from the likes of the education welfare service.', '© 2022 BBC.
