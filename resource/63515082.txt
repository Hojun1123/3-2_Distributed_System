', 'The RMT, which represents rail workers, said it would now enter "a period of intensive negotiations" with Network Rail and the rail companies after it received "the promise of an offer".', 'The strike had been called in a dispute over pay and conditions.', 'ScotRail communications director David Ross told BBC Scotland that the suspension of the Network Rail strikes was a "very positive development".', 'But he added: "It\'s too late in the day to change what we do tomorrow because the complexity of rewriting timetables and posting thousands of rosters for staff.', '"So a skeleton service will still operate [on Saturday] between 0730 and 1830 on just 11 routes within the central belt, Fife and Borders.', '"Our advice to passengers is use alternative means of transport if possible and if you do travel with us check before you leave the house so you know exactly what service is running."

', "The RMT has previously threatened to escalate the ScotRail dispute by walking out on the day of Scotland's rugby international against Argentina on 19 November and on every Friday and Saturday after that until Christmas.", 'ScotRail has previously offered all staff a 5% pay uplift plus add-ons, which it said would represent a 7.4% increase for the lowest-paid staff. ', 'It has urged the union to put that offer to its members, although the RMT has said it would "seriously consider" an 8.2% increase.', '© 2022 BBC.
