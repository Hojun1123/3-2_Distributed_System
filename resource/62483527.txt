Local health officials say five people, including a child, were treated for injuries.', 'Video footage shows tourists on a nearby beach at the time fleeing in panic.

The frontline is at least 225km (140 miles) away.', "An attack by Ukrainian aircraft? The base in Crimea would be very well defended, with surface-to-air missile coverage making a conventional bombing raid unlikely. That leaves air-launched cruise missiles - but so far in this conflict we've seen no evidence of this from Ukraine.", "What about ground-launched weapons? The Tochka-U ballistic missile's range is reckoned to be only about 75 miles. Longer-range missiles such as the Ukrainian-made Neptune could reach the target, but they have been used mainly against large warships; Ukraine claimed two of them sank the Russian guided-missile cruiser Moskva in April.", 'Western-developed Harpoon missiles are now in Ukraine, but these too are surface-to-ship. ', 'The US Himars (High Mobility Artillery Rocket System) has been the recent talk of the conflict. It launches extremely effective GPS-guided rockets, but only to a stated range of around 50 miles. The US has shown reluctance to send longer-range munitions for Himars for fear of escalating hostilities with Russia.

', 'But Mr Zelensky drew support from the prime ministers of Estonia and Finland, who asked why Russians were still able to get EU Schengen tourist visas. ', 'Direct Russian flights to the EU are banned, but Russians can travel to most of the EU overland - including via the Baltic states.', "A general EU visa ban appears unlikely for Russians, beyond those already under sanctions for their links to the Kremlin and Russia's military. But the issue looks set to be raised again among EU ministers.
