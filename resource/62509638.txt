However, it's still operated by Ukrainian technicians. ", '<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-62469740" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Moscow has recently been accused of using the plant "as a shield"</a> while its troops launch rockets from there towards nearby locations. ', 'And on Thursday, more shelling was reported - and the head of the UN issued a new warning about fighting near the nuclear site "leading to disaster".', 'Now two workers have told the BBC about the daily threat of kidnap, as well as their fears of either "radioactive contamination of the wider region" or a nuclear catastrophe. ', 'In the southern city of Nikopol is one of the most dangerous vantage points in Ukraine. ', "On the banks of the Dnipro River, it's possible to see the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant 10 miles across the water.", "It's a place which has seen heavy shelling over the past couple of weeks, with up to 120 rockets being reported in a single night.
