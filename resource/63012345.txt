', 'There was an immediate reaction in financial markets, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-63009173" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">as the pound sank</a> and UK stocks fell.', 'In an interview with BBC News political editor Chris Mason, the chancellor said: "I don\'t think it\'s a gamble at all. ', '"What was a gamble, in my view, was sticking to the course we are on."', 'Mr Kwarteng insisted not cutting taxes and continuing to follow the path of the previous government - led by former Prime Minister Boris Johnson - was more risky.', '"So what we had to do was have a reboot, a rethink," Mr Kwarteng said.', 'He said his mini-budget was not an admission of failure, as <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-63007423" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Labour suggested in response to his statement</a>, and a recession forecast by the Bank of England was "not inevitable"', 'But, he said, "we also recognise we could do things better".', 'He said his moves to <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-63007219" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">reduce income tax</a>, scrap a planned rise in National Insurance and support households with energy bills would "help the most vulnerable people in society get through a difficult time".', 'Asked whether the UK economy was now in recession, Mr Kwarteng said that while, "technically, the Bank of England said that there was a recession", he thought it "would be shallow" and he hoped "we would rebound and grow".', 'When pressed, the chancellor said he did not acknowledge that the UK was in recession and that one was not inevitable.', '<a href="https://twitter.com/TheIFS/status/1573303975817928705" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">The Institute of Fiscal Studies said</a> the richest 10% of households would gain the most from Mr Kwarteng\'s measures, which undo the tax rises introduced by former chancellor Rishi Sunak, who left office in July.', 'Labour\'s shadow business secretary Seema Malhotra told BBC Two\'s Newsnight: "What was really striking today in Parliament was the admission, effectively, of 12 years of failure of what the Conservatives have been doing.', '"And Kwasi Kwarteng and his colleagues failed to connect the fact that we\'ve got high taxes because we\'ve had low growth."', 'She added: "If you\'re going to have a plan for growth, it\'s got to be a proper plan.
