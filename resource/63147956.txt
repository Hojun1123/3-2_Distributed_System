', "The SpaceX Falcon rocket put them on a path to catch the orbiting outpost in about 29 hours' time.", 'Col Mann told the BBC that she hoped the mission would inspire future generations of Native Americans.', '"[I hope it] will inspire young Native American children to follow their dreams and realise that some of those barriers that are there or used to be there are being broken down," she said.', '"Anytime we are able to do something that is a first, or wasn\'t done in the past, it\'s so important," she added.
