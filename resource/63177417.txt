['<b class="ssrcss-hmf8ql-BoldText e5tfeyi3">Eurovision fans in Scotland have been left stunned after Glasgow lost out to Liverpool in the bid to host next year\'s event.</b>', "Glasgow had been the bookies' favourite, with its cheerleaders including former winner Lulu and First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.", 'But Liverpool can now expect thousands of visitors and a slice of the global spotlight in May.', 'Lulu said her heart sank when the announcement was made.', 'But she added: "You have to be a good loser. It\'s very important.', '"And in the end you know the UK is hosting and that\'s what we\'ve got to be grateful for - that we are now focused on supporting Liverpool doing a great job for Ukraine.', '"My heart sunk, I have to say. But I\'m such an old fart and have had a lot of disappointments in my life. I\'ve managed to get over them and I suppose I\'ll get over this one, but I thought we were going to do it."', 'Ms Sturgeon said she was "gutted" that Glasgow had missed out.', '"Congratulations, Liverpool. Gutted for Glasgow, but no doubt you\'ll do Eurovision and Ukraine proud," the first minister tweeted.', "Friday's announcement came after a hotly-contested bidding process, which saw 20 possible host cities cut to a final two.", "The show is coming to the UK for the first time in 25 years after this year's winner, Ukraine, was unable to take up hosting duties due to the war.", 'The M&amp;S Bank Arena in Liverpool will stage the 67th edition of the event on 13 May.', 'Essex singer Sam Ryder finished second place in May, making the UK the default hosts.', 'Broadcaster and Eurovision TV commentator Graham Norton announced the Eurovision host city on the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/b007tcw7/the-one-show" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">BBC\'s The One Show</a>.', 'Cities were judged on criteria including a suitable venue, strength of the cultural offer, commitment to making a financial contribution and "alignment with the BBC\'s strategic priorities".', 'The BBC said both cities had provided "incredibly strong bids" and each "proposed to reflect Ukrainian culture and music in their own unique way" but that Liverpool eventually won out.', 'Scottish fans voiced their disappointment at missing out to Liverpool on social media.', 'Anna took to Twitter to say, "Have a lot of mixed feelings tonight. ', '"I\'m obviously a little gutted Glasgow wasn\'t chosen, but genuine congratulations to Liverpool. I have no doubt they\'ll put on an amazing show for Ukraine."', 'Another fan, Fiona, also posted: "Gutted for Glasgow but I\'m sure Liverpool will be amazing hosts."', '"Gutted for Glasgow" was the first minister\'s reaction to the news that the city had lost out to Liverpool in its bid to host the 2023 Eurovision contest.', 'For once, the golden envelope which Graham Norton ripped open live on The One Show contained a genuinely surprising result.', 'You need only look at the faces of those gathered in Kelvingrove Art Gallery for the announcement. Shock, disappointment, and a sombre walk home in the Glasgow rain.', 'Lulu, one of the few people who can claim to have actually won the Eurovision Song Contest (Boom Bang-A-Bang in 1969) was convinced that her home city had won.', '"My heart sunk, I have to say, I thought we were going to do it."', 'The problem was that both cities thought they were going to do it. Both had exactly the same credentials: a good infrastructure, an arena with room for 10,000 fans, a track record for organising major events. Both are Unesco Cities of Music. Both are known for their humour and for their warm welcome. Either would throw a fine party.', "Scotland has played its part in Eurovision history. The 1972 contest was staged here, back in the day when the audience dressed in dinner suits and clapped politely for earnest French ballads. It's quite a different prospect now.", "As well as the vast social and economic benefits of having such a major event on your doorstep, there's the added emotion of the show being hosted in the UK because the actual winners, Ukraine, are unable to safely do so. Even the most hard-hearted Eurovision sceptic couldn't fail to be drawn in by that.", 'Although disappointed, Glasgow City Council leader Susan Aitken said she hoped Liverpool would "gie it laldy" for Ukraine.', 'The OVO Hydro, which would have been the venue for the show had Glasgow been chosen, tweeted "we are disappointed that Glasgow has not been chosen as host city of Eurovision 2023 but we know our friends and colleagues in Liverpool will do an incredible job."', 'And to Liverpool\'s M&amp;S Bank Arena: "you know where we are if you need a little extra laldy".', 'World Cup winner Jürgen Klinsmann invites you to subscribe to his daily World Cup newsletter.', '© 2022 BBC.
