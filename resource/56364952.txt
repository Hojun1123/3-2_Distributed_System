', 'There have been almost daily anti-BBC articles in Chinese state media since mid-February.', 'It follows a decision by the UK broadcasting regulator Ofcom <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-55931548" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">to revoke the licence</a> for China\'s state-run overseas broadcaster, CGTN.', 'For years, China has broadly criticised Western outlets for reports on affairs in Xinjiang and elsewhere in China, saying they should not intervene in China\'s "internal affairs".
