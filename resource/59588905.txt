In all, about 100 baristas and supervisors took part.', 'Starbucks workers in Buffalo began the campaign to unionise in August, saying they were overworked, but not listened to by the company.', 'The mobile app in particular has added to their workload, they said, by enabling multiple complicated orders to arrive in quick succession, which they are then under time pressure to fulfil.', 'The vote could set a precedent at the coffee chain, which has more than 8,000 company-owned stores across the US, none of which have been unionised since the 1980s.', 'Staff at three further locations in Buffalo and one store in Arizona have already applied to unionise.', 'The vote was held in the face of an all-out campaign by the company over the last four months to persuade staff to vote no.', 'Executives, and Starbucks founder Howard Schultz, were flown into Buffalo to lobby employees. They held meetings, sometimes individually with staff, and sent texts asking them to vote "no".', 'According to Workers United, the union to which the new Starbucks branch will be affiliated, the Buffalo stores were flooded with out-of-town Starbucks managers to try to discourage discussion of the issue among staff.', 'This amounted, the union said, to a campaign of "bullying and intimidation".', 'The coffee chain, which recently announced that it would be lifting its minimum wage to $15 an hour by next summer, has stressed that it is not anti-union, but argued that the issues raised by workers did not justify establishing a union.', "Starbucks had said having to deal with a union would complicate the company's ability to respond quickly to its workers' needs.", '"We want every partner to love working at Starbucks.
