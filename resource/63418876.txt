', '"We remain committed to net zero and to leading international and domestic action to tackle climate change. The UK is forging ahead of many other countries on net zero," she added.', 'Speaking to LBC, the minister said: "The UK continues to show global leadership as opposed to just a gathering of people in Egypt." ', 'Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer tweeted: "Britain showing up to work with world leaders is an opportunity to grasp.

The UK hosted last year's summit, COP26, in Glasgow and was attended by then-PM Boris Johnson.

', 'On Wednesday, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres told the BBC that he would like to see both the PM and King Charles in attendance. Now it looks like neither will be there. ', 'Given that the UK government was not just the host of COP26 but the main driving force behind its limited successes, it is unusual that it will not have a major political figure in attendance. ', 'While Alok Sharma will be there as the outgoing COP president, he is not of the same rank as a prime minister or monarch.', "The Egyptian organisers will likely be furious at this turn of events - and it will not augur well for the conference if the leaders of one of the world's leading lights in taking action on climate can't prioritise travelling to the gathering.
