', '"Our aim has always been to generate enough electricity to make the hospital site self-sufficient in the summer months when the days are longer," he said.', 'The panels are currently generating about 26MWh per day, the equivalent to the average daily energy needs of 3,250 UK households, Mr Best said.', 'The electricity generated is enough to meet the daytime running needs of the entire hospital, with output expected to almost double during the peak summer months, he added.', 'Head of sustainability Marc Beaumont added: "When you consider the size of the Castle Hill Hospital site and the amount of activity that goes on here, that\'s a huge amount of power that\'s required to keep it running. ', '"It\'s incredible to think that the power used to... to support many life-saving surgical procedures, and to keep our intensive care unit running right now is all completely self-generated, green electricity," he added.', 'The trust, which also runs Hull Royal Infirmary, is replacing 20,000 lights across both sites with LED bulbs and is to insulate buildings and install pumps to cut heating costs.', '<i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">Follow BBC East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire on </i><a href="https://www.facebook.com/BBCLookNorth/" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Facebook</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">, </i><a href="https://twitter.com/looknorthBBC" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Twitter</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">, and </i><a href="https://www.instagram.com/bbclooknorth/" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Instagram</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">.
