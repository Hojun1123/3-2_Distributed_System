', '"We won\'t close this any longer than we feel is justified by the balance of risks," he added.', 'Mr Waters said the decision to close the bridge "was not made lightly" and was based on "clear advice from structural engineers and conversations with the police".', '"The risk of a catastrophic event happening to the bridge is still low but it is too high for us to be able to risk it," the minister added.', 'The bridge has reopened for walkers on footpaths and cyclists who dismount their bikes, with marshals in place to monitor numbers.', 'Vehicles have been diverted to the other crossing, the nearby Britannia Bridge, which has previously had to close during periods of high winds. Mr Waters said that was a "rare event", which "generally happens for a matter of hours" at a time.', 'Officials are looking at potentially allowing emergency services vehicles weighing less than 7.5 tonnes across the Menai Bridge if the Britannia Bridge is closed.', 'Conservative MS Natasha Asghar said: "Closing the bridge at the last minute without prior warning for what could be potentially four months will not only hit residents, visitors and commuters but also hard-working businesses in the area.', '"Of course safety is paramount, I\'m not going to deny it for a single second, but how on earth are we only now aware of structural weaknesses here today?', '"A 200-year-old bridge which is used by nearly 50,000 vehicles every day should be regularly inspected."', 'Mr Waters said the bridge is "regularly" inspected to "industry standard" at two and six-year intervals.', 'Plaid Cymru MS for Ynys Mon Rhun ap Iorwerth called on the Welsh government to build a third crossing between Anglesey and the mainland.', 'In 2017, the Welsh government outlined <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-north-west-wales-42371980" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">plans for a third crossing</a> but it is currently on pause as part of a <a href="https://gov.wales/roads-review#section-90784" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">review</a> of all road building projects in Wales.
