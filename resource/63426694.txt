', "ScotRail, which is now nationalised, has described the RMT's demands as unaffordable. ", 'Trains are only running on three routes in the central belt, with all other services cancelled. ', "Fans heading for Scotland's first autumn rugby international at Murrayfield are advised to consider alternative arrangements, as there will be only a very limited service. ", 'The strike involves staff such as ticket examiners, station staff and cleaners. The three routes operating from 07:30 to 18:30 are:', 'The latest pay offer would have given workers a £500 uplift in return for using new technology on top of the 5% that had already been offered, which ScotRail said was the equivalent of a 7.5% pay rise for the lowest paid. ', "This is ScotRail's second 24-hour strike by RMT transport union members, to add to all those one-day stoppages in protest at other rail companies. Is this how a newly nationalised rail service is meant to look?", "The first RMT strike over ScotRail's pay offer was earlier this month, on the day the SNP conference departed Aberdeen.", 'Members moved from a vision of a greener, smooth-running Scotland in the P&amp;J Arena to the city centre, and a clunking re-engagement with a very different reality on the rails.

', "The Scottish government said it respected the workers' right to strike, but said the latest offer should have been put to the union members. ", 'The Scottish Conservatives described the strike as "selfish". Transport spokesman Graham Simpson added: "The militant RMT union is holding the whole country to ransom, and for every day that this chaos continues, ordinary travellers and small businesses will continue to suffer."', "ScotRail's RMT members previously went on strike on 10 October. An overtime and rest day working ban, also put in place by the union, has led to cancellations across the rail network over the past fortnight.
