Or at least our avatars will.', 'While for many people this all sounds fanciful, a growing number of companies are buying up space in the metaverse so that they can set up shop there. These firms include the likes of Adidas, Burberry, Gucci, Tommy Hilfiger, Nike, Samsung, Louis Vuitton, and even banks HSBC and JP Morgan.', "The question for such businesses, though, is what location do they pick? There are now some 50 or so different providers of worlds within the metaverse, with the most popular ones including The Sandbox, Decentraland, Voxels, and Somnium Space, plus Meta's own Horizon Worlds.", 'Retailers and other investors are having to gamble on which of these will go on to become the dominant force in the metaverse, gaining the most visits from our avatars.

Last year he spent $2.4m (£2m) worth of cryptocurrency (you have to use a crypto to make a purchase in the metaverse) buying up a chunk of space in Decentraland's dedicated area for fashion retail.", 'Mr Kiguel, who is the boss of cryptocurrency investment website Tokens.com, says he has already held a fashion show, and plans to rent out his space to fashion firms.', 'The idea for such retailers is that your avatar can pop into a metaverse clothing shop and buy items to be sent to you in the real world. Or alternatively, you could treat your avatar to a new item of computerised clothing.', 'While Mr Kiguel backs Decentraland he cautions that not all metaverse worlds will succeed. "It reminds me of the early days of social media. Similar to social media... the metaverse space will have some large winners and many niche metaverses that succeed," he says.', 'Hong Kong businessman Adrian Cheng has decided to buy in The Sandbox.
