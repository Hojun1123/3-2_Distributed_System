And due to a website called YaganKar, Ms Azizi has been able to earn money in her qualified field - as a graphic designer and animator.', 'YaganKar was set up in Canada in 2018 by Afghani migrant Jamshid Hashimi, to create remote work opportunities for skilled Afghans both inside and outside of their home country. Described as a talent platform, it links Afghani freelancers with would-be employers around the world.', 'Since signing up in May of this year, Mr Azizi has been hired for three projects. These have included designing a t-shirt illustration for a small Canadian fashion retailer called BigiNagi, and creating a logo for charity Canadian Women for Women in Afghanistan.', 'A single project fee of typically around $200 (£173) can cover her family\'s expenses for a month. "My family are depending on me," says Ms Azizi, who did not wish to provide a photograph of herself for this article.

Around 70% or 400 of the current 600 are based in Afghanistan, including around 140 women.', 'The rest are based in around 20 other countries, including the US, Canada, Australia, Italy and Indonesia. Around 20% of the total are female.', 'YaganKar makes its money by charging firms to post about their available work, and Mr Hashimi, its founder, hopes to continue to expand operations. He wants to have more than 1,000 Afghans on the books over the next year, and to launch a learning platform to help users increase their available skills.', '"Even before the fall of the government [to the Taliban], employment opportunities in Afghanistan were not ideal," he says. "But through the remote work, creator and gig economies we can scale Afghan talent [both at home and abroad] to the demands of the global market."', 'Lorraine Charles has long argued that allowing refugees to become remote workers can help plug skills gaps in advanced economies.', "She is the co-founder of London-based Na'amal, another social enterprise that works to help more refugees secure remote employment. It recently partnered with US-based global freelancers platform Upwork to help boost the number of refugees finding work via that website.", '"Obviously not all professions and sectors can do this [offer remote work], but if remote becomes the de-facto working model, you don\'t have to live in global capitals to have access to opportunity," says Ms Charles.', '"I see remote working as a democratization of employment. Opportunities aren\'t everywhere, but they can be with this new space we\'re living in."', 'More from the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-38507481" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">BBC\'s series taking an international perspective on trade.</a>', 'Remote work can give people a reason to stay in their home country, rather than seeking opportunities abroad.', 'In Venezuela more than seven million people have left the country since 2015, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-63279800" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">as the South American nation has endured a continuing economic and political crisis.</a>', 'But the website iWorker is giving some a reason to stay. It connects more than 900 locals to remote work opportunities from firms in the US, Canada and Europe.', 'The platform was set up in 2018 by Venezuelan entrepreneur Enrique Vervez and his American friend Jeb Koogler.', 'Mr Vervez had fled to Argentina that year with his wife, who was pregnant at the time.', 'IWorker now continues to list work ranging from marketing research to database management, video editing and graphic designing, and it is expanding to also help remote workers across the wider Latin America region, and in Africa.', 'What is especially helpful for workers in Venezuela is that they are paid in US dollars, thereby avoiding the inflation that has bedevilled the Venezuelan bolivar. Pay rates via iWorker start from $5.99 an hour.', 'Mr Vervez says the work they offer means that Venezuelans are "not forced to flee the country looking for work, giving them the power to decide if they want to leave or stay". ', 'He adds: "This keeps families together, and helps reduce the strain on neighbouring countries."', 'One Venezuelan who uses iWorker is Marcela Payares, 26, who lives in the capital with her mother and grandfather. She earns around $800 a month doing everything from research, to data entry and graphic design. ', 'Ms Payares says that if she instead worked for a local company she\'d be unlikely to earn more than £300 a month. She adds that her "personal growth has been huge".
