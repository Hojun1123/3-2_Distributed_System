', '"With a diagnosis, language is really a barrier. ', '"Sometimes they [healthcare settings] use an Indonesian interpreter, but some older generations of East Timor people don\'t speak the Indonesian language," Ms Jeronimo said.', 'Somerset Diverse Communities said it wanted to hear about the experiences of British people from other minority communities, as well as migrants to the UK. ', 'It is carrying out <a href="https://ccslovesomerset.org/health-inequalities/" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">the survey</a> for Somerset County Council which said they welcomed the findings so far.', 'Michał Pużyński from Somerset Diverse Communities said he had encountered people, particularly men, who had lived and worked in the county for as long as 10 years without accessing health services.', '"Many of them, they are just too proud to admit that they can\'t communicate properly so they\'ve never been registered with a GP, they\'ve tried to treat themselves at home," he said.', 'Mr Pużyński said he also thought it could be difficult for people to explain the details of their symptoms using medical terminology, even if they were able to speak English.', '"The language that is required, very often it\'s much more sophisticated. ', '"On a daily basis, if you\'re working in a local warehouse or factory, you\'re relying on basic English," he said.', 'Kirsten Rushby from Somerset Diverse Communities said people arriving in the county should be given immediate help.', '"It\'s really important that we provide a clear message and information about how our healthcare system works here, what you can expect. ', '"Also, our interpretation services need to be a little bit more robust," she said.', 'The charity said it knew of a Ukrainian guest who said the interpretation service was at best "fumbling" and it was aware of other cases where the wrong language was provided.', 'To get around the need for friends or family members being required to translate in potentially dangerous domestic abuse situations, the charity said it had suggested the NHS should provide interpreters for annual GP check-up appointments that patients could attend on their own.', 'The survey is ongoing.', '© 2022 BBC.
