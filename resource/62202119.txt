', '"Hollywood makes it look very, very interesting and very dramatic. And this is a little different. It can look a little anti-climactic," Ms Flores said.', 'Raytheon says the laser system has 20,000 hours of operational use, but Ms Flores would not be drawn on whether the system had been "used in anger" yet.', 'Initially the number of jobs created by the new centre is likely to be small, but could increase to potentially "hundreds of jobs".', 'That will depend on many factors of course, but the company believes that high-energy lasers could make up as much as 30% of of future air defence infrastructure.', 'While the firm would not be drawn on how much it would ultimately invest - citing pending financial results - it has already spent about £20m developing the Livingston site, the BBC understands.', 'It said the announcement was a "statement of faith"  in both the UK\'s engineering sector and the important nature of the technology.', 'World Cup winner Jürgen Klinsmann invites you to subscribe to his daily World Cup newsletter.', '© 2022 BBC.
