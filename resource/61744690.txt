', 'The development will see nearly 16,000 solar panels enclosed by a fence.', 'Residents were told it was needed to counter climate change.', 'Richmondshire District Council\'s leader Angie Dale said: "We are in a climate emergency, councillors declared one in 2019, and that does mean things will have to change in Richmondshire, whether we like it or not.', "The planning committee's chair councillor John Amsden told residents there was no right to maintain a view amid objections the solar farm would feature panels raised up to 12ft (4m) above the flood zone.", 'The <a href="https://www.bbc.com/lnp/ldrs" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Local Democracy Reporting Service</a> said a Northumbrian Water spokesman told the meeting there were few places where a solar generator could easily connect into the electricity grid, and the development would enable the firm to produce all the power for its Broken Scar treatment works.', "The development would save about 2,000 tonnes of C02 a year, producing 9MW of renewable energy, which the water utility company said would benefit 600,000 people, offsetting more than £600,000 in energy price increases to customers' bills in its first six months.", 'Residents of some of the 34 properties which will be directly affected by the development said having nearly 16,000 solar panels across 16.5 hectares of farmland which had been classed as "best and most versatile" would have a "major negative visual impact".', 'One resident told the committee: "This industrial installation will spoil the area. Is that what we want for our countryside?"', 'Another resident said: "The fence compound and security cameras will make it look like a prison compound which will look horrendous in such a picturesque setting."', 'They told the committee that while they supported solar farms in principle, the proposal was in the wrong location and would cause considerable harm to the wellbeing of the community.', 'However, farmer Jonathan Bell said leasing the land to Northumbrian Water for 30 years would provide a steady and reliable income whatever the weather.', '<i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">Follow BBC North East &amp; Cumbria on </i><a href="https://twitter.com/BBCNEandCumbria" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Twitter</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">, </i><a href="https://www.facebook.com/bbcneandcumbria" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Facebook</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2"> and </i><a href="https://www.instagram.com/bbcneandcumbria/" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Instagram</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">.
