', "He noted that other features causing concern for creators, such as a full-screen mode, recommendations and visibility of friends' posts, will be subject to further improvement.", '"We\'re going to stay in a place where we try and put your friends\' content at the top of feeds and in front of stories whenever possible," he said. ', '"But we\'re also going to need to evolve because the world is changing quickly. And we\'re going to have to change along with it."', 'The platform <a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/introducing-new-ways-to-collaborate-and-create-with-reels" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">announced</a> new tools for creators using its Reels feature on 21 July, letting them "Remix" previous public photo posts as Reels and simultaneously film and react to content on front and back cameras with a "Dual" feature.', 'Instagram also revealed that new videos which are less than 15 minutes long will be automatically uploaded as Reels in coming weeks.', 'In 2018 <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-43163544" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">shares of social media company Snap tumbled after Ms Jenner tweeted about her reluctance to use Snapchat</a>, to her 24.5million Twitter followers. ', 'Her tweet followed a controversial Snapchat re-design in response to increased competition from alternative social media platforms.

', 'At the time of writing, Ms Jenner has 360million followers on Instagram and Ms Kardashian has 325million.', 'Both shared a post to their followers on Monday which said "Make Instagram Instagram again" and in brackets added "stop trying to be tiktok i just want to see cute photos of my friends".
