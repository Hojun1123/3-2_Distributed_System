Their bills, in terms of gas and electric is more than doubling and that\'s just not sustainable," the minister told the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/m00187vz" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">BBC\'s Evening Extra programme</a>.', '"They are seeing an increased pressure with families coming towards them to seek help, to seek assistance, but also to seek a place where they can stay for that day or for the afternoon until maybe their children get home."', 'She told the programme that some centres were under "severe" financial strain and faced "potential" closure without government intervention. ', '"We\'re trying to see what we can do.  I did release a payment for hundreds of organisations recently, but obviously these organisations get funding and deliver services from right across government, so we need a whole government approach to this, but we also need additional monies."', 'Ms Hargey said politicians were "limited" in what they could do because of the lack of a fully functioning devolved government at Stormont.', 'Northern Ireland has been without a functioning power-sharing executive since February, when the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) pulled its first minister of his post in  in protest over the post-Brexit trading arrangement known as the Northern Ireland Protocol.', 'Fresh elections to the Northern Ireland Assembly were held last month, but the DUP has refused to nominate a Speaker or return to the executive until their concerns over the protocol are resolved.
