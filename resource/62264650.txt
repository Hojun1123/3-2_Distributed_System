', 'This was a slight increase from one in 16 the previous week, the ONS said.', 'Cases are also continuing to increase in England, where one in 17 people were estimated to have the virus last week.', 'But the figure for Wales remained the same - one in 17 - while there was an improvement in Northern Ireland from one in 17 to one in 20.', 'The figures, published in the latest <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/bulletins/coronaviruscovid19infectionsurveypilot/22july2022" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">ONS Coronavirus Infection Survey</a>, suggest about 3.8m people - one in 17 of the UK population - has the virus.', 'That is up by a quarter of a million - or 7% - on the week before when there were 3.5m Covid infections recorded.', 'The number of people testing positive across the UK has been rising since the start of June but the rate of rise is showing signs of slowing down.', 'Kara Steel, ONS senior statistician for the survey, said experts were seeing some uncertain trends in the latest data across the UK, as well as in some English regions and among some age groups.', 'She added: "It is too early to say if this most recent wave is starting to peak, but we will continue to closely monitor the data."', 'The current wave is being driven by the coronavirus subvariants Omicron BA.4 and BA.5, which are more transmissible than previous strains.', 'But high levels of Covid antibodies among the population - either from vaccination or previous infection - mean the number of people seriously ill or dying remain low.', 'First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the virus was not going to disappear any time soon.', 'She said: "As we go into winter, we may well see further waves of Covid. It is a virus that is continuing to mutate and change and that\'s causing real challenges."', 'On Wednesday it emerged an average of 1,770 people in Scottish hospitals had the virus last week - an increase of 6.1% on the previous week, according to Public Health Scotland.

But it is still substantial and there is still quite a number of people who are getting serious illness, including long Covid, who have no obvious reason why that is occurring so we need to be aware of that."', 'Going forward, Prof Kao said he believed there would be nothing like the level of infections that have been seen in the past as people have more immunity.', 'But he said it could be a rocky road as other infections, such as flu and RSV, will put the NHS under strain in the winter.', 'He said: "We might expect to see some additional restrictions.
