", 'Among the hundreds of SSEN workers battling to get powered restored is project manager Robert Weatherspoon.', 'He described the past five days as "very challenging" but said it was getting easier as more lines are reconnected.', '"It could be anything, a wire down, trees on the line, damage to the insulators, wires sitting on the steel which wouldn\'t be immediately obvious," he said.', '"With the amount of debris that\'s been blown about, you just don\'t know. So you\'ve got to really think and have a good look at what you\'re dealing with.', '"It\'s long hours, but when you speak to the customers and they\'ve been without power for three or four days, in a remote location, you\'re quite happy to keep working on to get those people restored."', 'Graeme Keddie, SSEN\'s director of corporate affairs, told <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/live:bbc_radio_scotland_fm" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">BBC Radio\'s Good Morning Scotland </a>the storm had caused "devastation" to parts of the network.', 'He said: "We are confident we have a handle on what we can restore in the next couple of days. ', '"We are looking at making really good progress today and tomorrow and we expect it will be the last final few homes on Friday."', 'Mr Keddie\'s comments came after power companies <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-59466487" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">faced criticism for poor communication</a>, with some residents claiming they were "completely abandoned".

', 'He used an open fire and a gas hob on a propane bottle supply in the interim. He believed the response could have been better handled by SSEN. ', '"The storm on Friday was catastrophic, but they could have mitigated the situation if they had maintained the infrastructure better," he said.', "Mr Anderson said he was twice on hold at SSEN's call centre for 90 minutes. He declined an offer by SSEN to go into hotel accommodation, as he keeps animals on his land. ", '"The guys on the ground are working hard but the biggest problem is their communications," he added.', '"We are only 15 miles west of Aberdeen here, it\'s supposed to be the energy capital of Europe. And yet we can\'t get decent power infrastructure."', 'Thousands of people in the north of England are also <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-59483500" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">still living with power outages</a>.
