', '"I\'ve had ongoing contact with the trust about this, the trust have apologised that the information I was given was inaccurate - not so much the fact this equipment had broken down and that cardiac procedures had to be postponed," he said.', '"But I accept the trust\'s explanation that on this occasion it was the size of the equipment was the issue and they were able to source it from the supplier in Germany - and that the protocol on this occasion was not the problem."', 'Asked if he would apologise for making the initial claim, Sir Jeffrey said: "I obviously spoke on the basis of information I had been given from reliable medical sources.', '"I accept the information was not entirely accurate and was placed in the public domain by me, and I regret that this happened."
