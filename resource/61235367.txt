', 'The organisation, which promotes sustainability and energy efficiency, did not give exact details of how it came to this figure.', '"Stats or prices related to individual appliances depend on several factors, including model, functionality and individual usage," it said.', 'Brian Horn, Senior Insight and Analytics consultant at the EST, said there were practical things consumers could do.', '"If something doesn\'t need to be on, then you should switch it off at the wall or unplug it," he said. "Everything else, just try and make it as easy as possible to turn it off. ', '"If you make sure that the plug is accessible, if you can just switch it off, so you don\'t need to unplug it.
