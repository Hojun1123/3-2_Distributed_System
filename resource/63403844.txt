Jobs and businesses have been destroyed and livelihoods taken away.', '"The disease has caused widespread and long-term physical and mental illness, grief and untold misery.', '"Its impact will be felt worldwide, including in the United Kingdom, for decades to come."', 'The identity of the core participants for this module were also unveiled.', 'These are the individuals and organisations which will have enhanced rights to see documents and make submissions.', 'Alongside government departments, they will also include a host of groups representing some of the most vulnerable in society, including people with disabilities, children, women at risk of domestic violence and those who developed "long Covid".', 'Mr Keith said the pandemic "reached out and affected almost every person" but its impact was not equally felt.', 'He said it was important to assess whether the risks these groups faced was properly taken into account.', 'A further preliminary hearing for the module will take place in early 2023, with public hearings starting in the summer. These are scheduled to last for about eight weeks.', 'World Cup winner Jürgen Klinsmann invites you to subscribe to his daily World Cup newsletter.', '© 2022 BBC.
