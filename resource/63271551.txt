', 'Mr Hunt, who was appointed on Friday after his predecessor Kwasi Kwarteng was abruptly sacked, has confirmed the government will set out its tax and spending plans on 31 October. ', 'He has already <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-63268238" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">signalled that some taxes could rise and public spending may fall</a>.', 'Mr Bailey said the Bank will not take any action on interest rates until after this fiscal plan is announced, describing this as "the correct sequence" of action.

', 'Last month, it was revealed that Mr Kwarteng had refused to allow the OBR to review the impact of his mini-budget on the economy before he delivered the statement. ', "The governor's intervention comes just hours after Mr Hunt told the BBC that some taxes could rise in the coming months and some departments could see their budgets slashed. ", 'Marking a significant change in government policy, the chancellor told the Today programme that difficult decisions will be needed "across the board". ', 'Taking questions after his speech in Washington, Mr Bailey signalled that he was in lockstep with the new chancellor. ', '"I can tell you that I spoke to Jeremy Hunt, the new chancellor, yesterday", Mr Bailey said. ', '"I can tell you that there was a very clear and immediate meeting of minds between us about the importance of fiscal sustainability and the importance of taking measures to do that."', 'He added that the comment was intended as a "clear message for markets".', 'Â© 2022 BBC.
