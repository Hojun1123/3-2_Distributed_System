', 'One of those looking forward to seeing the drone in action is Sgt Paul Terry of North Wales Police.  ', "He works with the force's own drone unit, as well as with the Ogwen Valley Mountain Rescue Team as a volunteer. ", '"From a rescue point of view, we often see situations where people rely on their mobile phones to report an incident, an accident or report that they are lost," he said.', '"But in the mountains of Snowdonia there are a lot of areas where there is poor or no network signal.  ', '"That can be life-changing in a rescue situation. ', '"And if there\'s a potential to provide greater coverage, and reliable coverage during an incident, what we can have is a two-way conversation between a casualty and a recue team to get better information in order to get better rescue resources and resolve an incident more quickly."', 'World Cup winner Jürgen Klinsmann invites you to subscribe to his daily World Cup newsletter.', '© 2022 BBC.
