', 'Under the government scheme, householders will still pay for all the gas and electricity they use.', "But the government's Energy Price Guarantee will now limit the price that suppliers can charge for each unit of energy.", "Some customers' bills will still exceed £2,500 this year, if they use more energy than the typical household. ", "Kevin Shiels, the utility regulator's director of retail and consumer protection, explained that the scheme was not a price cap.", '"What [the scheme does] is reduce the amount that every household pays per unit of energy, whether it\'s electricity or gas. ', '"There\'s a separate scheme for electricity and one for gas and you will get that no matter what supplier you\'re with. ', '"Customers don\'t have to do anything to avail of this - it\'s applied automatically to them from 1 November and the benefit is backdated to 1 October because these schemes kicked in in the rest of the UK on 1 October."', 'The Energy Price Guarantee is separate from the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/getting-the-energy-bills-support-scheme-discount" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">£400 Energy Bills Support Scheme</a> which is an additional government plan to help people with energy costs this winter.', 'Households are due to be credited with the £400 payment automatically. ', 'But Mr Shiels said there were still decisions to be made about how customers would get this money.', '"In the rest of the UK, customers are receiving the payment in the form of six monthly payments of £67," he told the BBC\'s Evening Extra programme. ', '"The discussion in Northern Ireland is whether that type of phased payment should happen or whether we should get a one-off £400 lump sum payment."', 'Mr Sheils said UK government ministers were "still working that through" but he expected a decision will be made within the next few weeks. ', '"I\'m still hopeful it will be this side of Christmas but I can\'t guarantee anything," he said. ', 'BBC News NI asked the main electricity and gas suppliers in Northern Ireland what the cap on prices would mean for their customers.', '"Consumers in Northern Ireland will welcome the Energy Price Guarantee as it will reduce their electricity and gas bills," said Peter McClenaghan of the Consumer Council.', '"The scheme will apply a discount to the unit prices of electricity and gas and all suppliers will apply the same discount."', 'However, Mr McClenaghan said that would mean that some energy suppliers\' prices "will still be much higher than others".', 'He encouraged customers to shop around and compare tariffs from different suppliers to make sure they are getting the best price per unit. ', 'By switching to a supplier with a lower tariff, he said some households "could make savings of over £500". ', 'Mr McClenaghan added: "Consumers should know that their exact electricity and gas bills will still depend on how much energy they use - as the scheme is a discount - not a price cap. ', '"We also encourage any consumers who are struggling to pay their energy bills or to top-up their meter, to contact their supplier directly for help and information."', "Sinead Quinn from Derry Against Fuel Poverty told BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme on Tuesday that she is afraid some people may miss out on saving money. ", '"The amount of money that people could save is phenomenal, but the biggest issue that I have is that they will have to switch [suppliers] to get that," Ms Quinn said. ', '"I don\'t necessarily think that when everyone heard about the energy price guarantee that they thought that would have to happen.', '"I think people just thought it would be automatic and it would be uniform across all suppliers, and I\'m worried people are going to lose out on a lot of saving."', 'Ms Quinn fears people, particularly older people, could lose out because they "aren\'t aware, don\'t do the internet or are afraid to switch".', 'On Monday, Power NI keypad customers reported having their electricity cut off when topping up and changing their tariff to the new lower rates. ', 'The company told BBC News NI that some customers were "having some difficulties" getting their 40-60-digit tariff change code. ', 'A spokesperson said: "We apologise for any inconvenience this is causing. ', '"We are working to get this resolved as a matter of urgency and would ask those customers affected to email home@powerni.co.uk with \'Keypad\' in the subject line and we will get back to you as soon as possible."', 'It is understood the problem has primarily affected app users and the reason the number of households affected is so high is due to large numbers changing to the discounted tariff at once. ', 'On Tuesday, Belfast City Council passed a proposal for a Fuel Poverty Hardship Fund, which would involve one-off £100 payments being made to those most in need. ', 'The proposal was put forward by Green Party councillor Anthony Flynn.', 'He said "I am glad that council has agreed our proposal today to set up an emergency scheme, intended to provide much needed support for vulnerable people and families this winter who are due to face immense hardship."', 'A further report detailing administration of the scheme will come over the next few weeks.', '© 2022 BBC.
