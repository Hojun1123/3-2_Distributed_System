When redundancies were made, she didn't think the selection process was fair, and declined to be put on a waiting list to return to the company in the future.", 'Virgin Atlantic says it ran a lawful and open redundancy process after full consultation with recognised unions, and ensured people were treated "fairly and with compassion".', 'Ms Dhillon has kept in touch with many of her former colleagues, who felt forced out, but were still determined to return - and some have done so in 2022.
