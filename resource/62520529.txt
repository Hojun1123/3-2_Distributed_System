World famous artists [such as] Def Leppard, Pulp, come from here. We\'ve always been known for music," he said.', 'Wendy Kingswood said it was "brilliant" news to be shortlisted, adding: "It would make Sheffield stand out for once - it needs something like that, something to put it on the map."', 'Jayden Kelly said while he was not a Eurovision fan, he felt it could give local acts a platform to succeed.', '"If it comes to Sheffield, a lot of people love their music, so it would be a great opportunity for them to get their chance to compete, but you won\'t see me singing anything!"', 'Massive Eurovision fan Gifty Barker said the city would be the perfect fit, adding her "fingers are crossed" it will be chosen.', '"Amazing, I can\'t wait.

It\'s a great city bursting with great people and fantastic character - the perfect backdrop for an iconic show like Eurovision."', 'Leeds City Council deputy leader Jonathan Pryor said: "Leeds is perfectly placed to put on a show. We have to remember it\'s Ukraine\'s party, we\'re just holding it in our house.', '"We\'ve got so much to offer, so much to show. Leeds is one of those cities which is always underestimated and overlooked and I think now is the time to open our doors and not just welcome Ukraine to our city, but the world too."', '<i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">Follow BBC Yorkshire on </i><a href="https://www.facebook.com/BBCYorkshire/" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Facebook</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">, </i><a href="https://twitter.com/bbclooknorth" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Twitter</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2"> and </i><a href="https://www.instagram.com/bbcyorkshire/" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Instagram</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">.
