They will not get the operation currently in the SWAH because of the manpower crisis and they will have to transfer," he explained.', '"In general surgical true emergencies - appendicitis, a bowel obstruction - the time is not imminent, it\'s not seconds or minutes. ', '"Quite often throughout Northern Ireland it is several hours before you get to theatre without any harm or consequence," he said.', '"I think we\'ve got to dial down the noise to suggest fear to the people of Fermanagh."', "Also appearing on the programme, DUP's Deborah Erskine said she thought the creation of an elective surgical hub would secure the future of the hospital.
