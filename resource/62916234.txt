", '"I was absolutely happy to take the picture - it\'s the highlight of my photography career," he told BBC News.', 'Astronomer Dr Ed Bloomer, who was one of the competition judges, said the image was one of the best comet photographs in history.', '"The perfect astrophotograph is the collision of science and arts. Not only is it technically sophisticated and projects the viewer into deep dark space, but also it\'s visually arresting and emotional," Dr Hannah Lyons, assistant curator of art at Royal Museums Greenwich, told BBC News.', 'The judges looked at more than 3,000 entries from around the world.', 'For their winning image, Yang Hanwen and Zhou Zezhen, both 14, worked together to photograph the Andromeda Galaxy, one of the closest and largest neighbours of the Milky Way.', 'The image shows the stunning colours of a galaxy near our own.

The IC 1805 is an area of huge amounts of ionised gas and interstellar dust. A strong stellar wind blows the surrounding material outwards, creating a cave-like hollow shape in a gas cloud. ', '"It is very difficult to capture dark nebula with any kind of clarity," explained Dr Ed Bloomer.', "Astrophotography was important, he added, because it revealed features of the cosmos that the human eye couldn't see just by looking at the night sky.", 'Weitang Liang took this picture of the Helix Nebula in Río Hurtado, Chile, at the Chilescope observatory.', '"It\'s easy to see how the ancients used to stargaze into the heavens and imagine that the cosmos was looking back, keeping a watchful eye over us," judge Imad Ahmed said.', 'This image by Pauline Woolley, combining pictures taken by large telescopes, won the prize for innovation', 'It shows how the sun changes over time using the idea of tree-ring dating.', 'Using an ordinary camera, Lun Deng captured this image of Milky Way rising above the Minya Konka Mountain, the highest peak in Sichuan China.', '<b class="ssrcss-hmf8ql-BoldText e5tfeyi3">All images subject to copyright.</b>', '© 2022 BBC.
