The hotter they get, the harder they have to work and the more energy they use," says Dr Roz.', "Which means the battery life gets drained more quickly, especially as it's harder to cool.", '"They also use energy to monitor their own state, and basically have to do more work."', 'Dr Roz adds we often turn up screen brightness when outside in the sunshine, which can also have an impact.', "If you've noticed a slight change in your screen, the heat might have had an impact.", '"If it\'s an older phone, if there\'s a slight defect in it, the heat will magnify it," says Dr Roz.', "She adds that screen protectors can often hold more heat inside, which isn't good in hot conditions.
