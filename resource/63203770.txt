['<b class="ssrcss-hmf8ql-BoldText e5tfeyi3">Wales is already seeing the impact of the cost of living on people\'s health, a public health boss has warned.</b>', 'Dr Kelechi Nnoaham said conditions like diabetes can worsen when people cannot afford a healthy diet and there has already been "a significant increase" in depression and anxiety.', 'He said we need to "go beyond lip service" and address inequalities.', 'The Welsh government said it takes a government-wide, long-term approach towards tackling poverty.', '"The cost of living crisis is going to do exactly what the Covid crisis did," said Dr Nnoaham, the director of public health at Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board.', '"I don\'t think we have done enough as a society to tackle those disparities."', 'Dr Nnoahm said communities need reaching out to in ways that are "genuine and not tokenistic", or "we\'re going to create a society that is even more divided between the rich and the poor".', '"We have a fairly bumpy few years or months ahead of us," he said.', 'His health board covers Rhondda Cynon Taf, Bridgend and Merthyr Tydfil - areas particularly badly hit by Covid, and with large pockets of deprivation.', 'As the cost of living bites, services that support the poorest are already starting to see a spike in demand.', '"As you can imagine, queries about fuel bills are now starting to come through - people who are extremely concerned about whether they should go on a fixed term, or if there are discounts they can get," said Paula Hodge, head of the information hub at Cynon Linc community centre.', 'The centre is home to a new GP surgery, activity sessions for the over-50s, a cafe, soft play area and other services.', 'Ms Hodge explained that even when government initiatives are announced, it leads to an increase in calls to their services.', '"We had quite a large spike when the £150 was being claimed via the council," she said, referring to the rebate the UK government made available to those in council tax bands A to D earlier this year.', '"It\'s not always a straightforward process and some people struggle with the telephone, let alone online. ', '"We\'re a solutions-based organisation - we could dwell on all the negatives, but actually we need to solve them. We can\'t solve everything, but I can guarantee we\'ll try."', 'Lynda Stokes, 79, regularly attends the tai chi sessions at the centre and said rising costs have made her more careful.', '"I don\'t over-buy and I use up what I\'ve got," she said, adding that she contacted her gas provider to agree an amount she could afford.', '"I pay £150 a month, which I can just about cope with."', 'Elaine Parker, 84, who uses her car to get to the exercise sessions and see friends at the centre, said: "I know petrol prices are coming down at the moment, but if it goes up any more it limits what you can do.', '"I\'m really, really worried about not being able to heat my house enough to keep myself warm."', 'Both said the services available at Cynon Linc were invaluable.', '"It\'s absolutely brilliant," said Mrs Parker. "It\'s a lifeline for a lot of older people because we\'re socialising again."', 'Ruth Bridge, the "ageing well" manager for Age Connects Morgannwg charity, which is based at the centre, explained that offering nail cutting services on site also reduces demands on emergency health services.', '"Having your nails cut on a regular basis means you\'re less likely to catch them in rugs or bedding - preventing you from any sorts of falls," she said, adding that rheumatism and poor mobility can impede a person\'s ability to look after their own nails.', '"It\'s not just the fact they have had their nails done that day. They have got out the house. They\'ve built a rapport with the nail technicians - and that confidence means that they can sometimes divulge any other worries and we can signpost them effectively."', 'Darren Thomas set up a mental health charity, Signposted Cymru, a year ago, following his own recovery from a mental health crisis.', '"We\'ve had an increase of 500% in the people walking through the door in the last four months," he said. ', '"We were paying about £1,000 a month to counsellors, we\'re now paying £6,000 a month and I think that\'s going to go up again this month because of the volume of people coming in.', '"People are struggling with anxiety and depression at the moment. Every day they\'re watching on TV that fuel prices are going up, food is going up, but their wages are not - they\'re at their wits\' end."', 'Dr Nnoaham said the health service in Wales was not immune to rising costs either. ', 'The health minister recently acknowledged the NHS in Wales was facing an unforeseen rise in costs of £206m.', '"Don\'t forget, the health system is facing its own cost of living challenge - you might call it the \'cost of operating challenge\'," said Dr Nnoaham.', '"We have to keep the lights on when there are already deficits."', 'He added that staff were not shielded from these financial pressures, with some health services setting up foodbanks and loan systems to support them.', 'The Welsh government said it recognised the importance of tackling poverty and inequality and that its response was government-wide and long-term.', 'A spokesperson added: "This year alone we are spending more than £1.6bn on schemes that target the cost-of-living crisis and on programmes that put money back in people\'s pockets. But the key levers for tackling poverty - powers over the tax and welfare system - sit with the UK government. ', '"We will continue to all we can with the powers we have to tackle inequalities and improve outcomes for everyone in Wales."', '© 2022 BBC.
