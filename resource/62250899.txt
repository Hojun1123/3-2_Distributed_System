They will remember the early warnings from other countries about the vulnerability of care homes. ', 'Care providers will recount their struggle to get protective equipment; what they saw as the slowness of government guidance; the rapid discharge of hospital patients into care homes, some taking with them the virus and above all, their sense of being forgotten. ', 'Families who were unable to see or in too many cases, say goodbye to their loved ones, are likely to have their say later in the inquiry. ', 'But in weighing up our preparedness for the pandemic, there is one number that perhaps tells the most powerful story. In the first wave between March and June 2020, nearly 20,000 care home residents died of Covid in England and Wales. At that time, it represented more than a third of the total number of deaths.', 'Jo Goodman, co-founder of Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice campaign, said: "Today was an emotional day for those of us who have lost loved ones and it meant a lot to hear Baroness Hallet recognise the devastating nature of bereavement and the pain we\'ve been through. ', '"Ultimately, all bereaved families want the same thing, which is to make sure that lessons are learnt from our devastating losses to protect others in the future."', 'Charles Persinger, who is part of the campaign and lost his mother and wife to Covid, added: "We\'ve waited a long time to get to this point - we would have liked the inquiry to start sooner. But what is important now is to really get to the bottom of the mistakes that were made."', "Several reports have already put the UK government's handling of the pandemic under the spotlight.", 'Last October, a report by MPs on <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-58876089" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">the Health and Social Care Committee and the Science and Technology Committee</a> said the UK\'s failure to do more to stop Covid spreading early in the pandemic was one of the country\'s worst public-health failures.', 'And a report by <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-59342607" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">spending watchdog the National Audit Office last November</a> found ministers had not been properly prepared for a pandemic such as Covid, and lacked detailed plans on shielding, job-support schemes and school disruption.', 'The Scottish government has launched <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-59659110" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">its own Covid inquiry, led by judge Lady Poole.</a>', 'The Covid pandemic had a devastating impact on ethnic minority communities in the UK.
