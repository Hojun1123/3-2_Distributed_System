Dozens of small drones had also been received, <a href="https://twitter.com/FedorovMykhailo/status/1544314949496872960?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Mr Fedorov tweeted.</a>', 'The military "warmate" drones, according to Mr Bronk, are a type of loitering munition manufactured in Poland. According to the company\'s website, the drone "constitutes a good alternative for anti-tank guided missiles".', 'According to Mr Fedorov, hobby and commercial drones have already shown their effectiveness on the battlefield. ', 'Russia has also made use of them. ', 'Earlier this year, Mr Fedorov called on market leader <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-61179022" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">DJI to stop selling drones in Russia and,</a> in a significant intervention for a Chinese firm, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-61179022" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">it halted sales in both Russia and Ukraine.</a>', '"Russia is using hobby/commercial drones to strike and conduct reconnaissance in their unprovoked and unfair war," Mr Fedorov wrote.', '"It is crucial that the world\'s largest commercial drone-maker, DJI, stopped sales in Russia."', "Valerii Iakovenko, co-founder of Ukrainian company DroneUA, told BBC News that DJI's action had pushed up costs to Ukraine, while Russia was still able to continue to obtain drones via Belarus.", 'His company had been supplying drones and robotics to the government since before the war.', "Drones, along with Elon Musk's Starlink satellite internet system and professional radio equipment, were now among the most sought-after technology, he said.", 'And even small ones were useful mostly providing field data, locating enemy troops and correcting artillery fire.', '"A huge number of volunteer operators that joined the Ukrainian forces are also making a difference," Mr Iakovenko said.', '"Drone pilots of small consumer drones are providing aerial intelligence along the whole front line.', '"It is all about the speed of information exchange between the field and in the general staff, to make decisions almost immediately."', 'This video can not be played', 'Watch: The volunteers using drones to monitor Russian troops', 'Mr Bronk says Ukrainians in particular have been very inventive in finding ways to source and then use commercial, as well as military-grade drones.', 'This includes "using them as improvised loitering munitions to strike targets at significant distance, including, recently, an oil refinery in Rostov with a commercial grade UAV with an improvised warhead".', 'But tactics, he warns, are changing.', '"What\'s happened in the last couple of months in Donbas is that the Russians have managed to concentrate their electronic warfare assets and integrate them well with their ongoing operations. ', 'As a result, Mr Bronk says, whenever Ukraine sends up a small UAV using radio remote control "the Russian electronic warfare kit picks it up and immediately either takes it over or just cuts the command link electronically and forces it to return".', 'To avoid this, instead of being flown by remote control, small drones have to be programmed to fly a set route and have targets identified when footage is analysed on their return. This slow process is of limited value against moving targets, he said.', 'Mr Bronk felt that what Ukraine needed were loitering munitions capable of targeting and attacking Russian electronic warfare systems. ', 'While hobbyist drones were useful, at the moment "grassroots support in terms of generating military equipment is probably of as much value in terms of morale for the people who are contributing, as well as the people on the front lines".
