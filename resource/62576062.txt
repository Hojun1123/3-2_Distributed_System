Many of the same banners were draped over the same railings at the last hustings in 2019.", 'Some were slightly taken aback though at the scale and ferocity of the event, with insults and the occasional egg flying while a large sound system boomed out some rather sweary speeches.', 'There was a fairly partisan atmosphere inside at times too, with members booing and heckling some questions from the host, broadcaster Colin Mackay.', 'Political leaders are at pains to paint any abuse as the work of an extremely vocal minority.', 'But there is no mistaking the fact that politics has a fairly angry tinge to it right now.', "People are struggling amid rising prices and fuel bills, and it's only going to get worse as we move into winter.", 'Trust in politicians was plumbing new depths even before the cost of living crisis, and now inflation and interest rates are on the rise and wage disputes are commonplace.', 'Whoever wins the Tory leadership is going to face a huge challenge in cooling the atmosphere of debate and bringing people together in such circumstances.', '<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-62574115" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Read more from Phil here</a>', 'World Cup winner Jürgen Klinsmann invites you to subscribe to his daily World Cup newsletter.', '© 2022 BBC.
