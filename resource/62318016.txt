Despite instruction from Lewis Fish, head of product at Opsydia, I can't see it.", '"It is very difficult," he says. "They\'re intentionally very fine, and it is really trained jewellers they are aimed at." ', 'But why would anyone want to write on the inside of a diamond?

Inside is a pulsed laser that emits very short laser bursts. ", 'Such high-powered bursts can accurately manipulate materials like diamonds and other gems at very small scales.', "However, just pointing the laser at a diamond is not enough - the diamond's structure would scatter the beam.", '"Diamond is about the most difficult material out of the transparent materials to process with lasers," says Mr Rimmer.', "Opsydia's system tunes the laser so that it can pass through the surface of the diamond, usually to a depth of about a quarter of a millimetre.", "Instead of randomly bouncing around the diamond, the laser comes to a pinpoint focus to create the inscription to suit the client's need.", 'If the diamond needs an identification number which is invisible to anyone without powerful microscopes, then the system can alter the diamond at the molecular level.', 'However, if a jeweller wants its logo to be visible then the laser can be used to make bigger changes to the carbon structure of the diamond.', 'At the moment Opsydia can assemble only a small number of the £400,000 ($480,000) machines at a time. But it is expanding its operation and expects soon to be selling dozens of the machines a year.', 'Mr Rimmer is optimistic that the laser technology will have other applications too.', "The laser can make atomic-scale changes to create circuitry inside the diamond. That could be useful for making instruments for radiation detection, where a diamond's durability is also an asset.", 'Potentially such circuitry could also be used in quantum computers - machines that can perform complex calculations in a fraction of the time taken by existing devices.', 'Quantum computers work by exploiting the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/technology-59300301" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">weird quantum properties</a> of individual particles.
