', "The mega restaurant, which could house 2,300 diners at a time, had spent nearly a half a century in Hong Kong's waters. It drew visitors like the Queen, Richard Branson and Tom Cruise, and featured in multiple Cantonese and Hollywood films. ", 'But for years, losses had been mounting, and the pandemic dealt a fatal blow.', "For some, the restaurant's departure was symbolic of what was happening in Hong Kong.

Hong Kong to New York, New York to Hong Kong, London," says Vinny Lauria, who runs a number of Hong Kong restaurants.', 'But, he adds, the restaurant business has "wisened up" with the increased arrival of wealthy mainland Chinese in the city.

", 'Hong Kong had long flourished as a financial powerhouse. And since Britain returned the former colony to China in 1997, the city had become a gateway for foreign companies to do business with China.', 'It had major advantages over regional competitors because of its sophisticated financial system, a transparent rule of law, English-speaking workers and links around the world. ', 'But ahead of the handover in 1997, Fortune magazine published a cover story  - "The death of Hong Kong" - lamenting that "the naked truth about Hong Kong\'s future can be summed up in two words: It\'s over."', 'Both foreign observers and many locals feared that Beijing\'s influence would increase immediately, and that Chinese soldiers would soon be roaming the city\'s streets, arresting people. Western newspapers also predicted that annual commemorations of <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-48445934" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre</a> - a taboo topic in China - would be banned.', "But it would be another 20 years before Hongkongers' freedoms were threatened - several pro-democracy leaders and activists, and even a media tycoon are behind bars now.

The zone's combined GDP already matches that of South Korea. ", '"The future of Hong Kong is the Greater Bay Area. You can get from Hong Kong to Shenzhen in 14 minutes. The joke is that it\'s faster to go to Shenzhen than other people\'s houses in Hong Kong," Mr Zeman said.', "While Hong Kong is expected to become more integrated with China, experts say it still won't lose its unique place in the financial world.", '"For many Westerners, it\'s going to feel like another Chinese city. For the Chinese - individuals and companies - Hong Kong is still this wonderful airlock to the world from outside the mainland. It\'s where the legal system is predictable, political pressures on business are a lot less than they are on the mainland," Mr Overholt said.', 'And as the US increasingly turns away Chinese companies from its stock markets, Hong Kong will benefit. Around 100 mainland firms are at risk of delisting in the US.', 'Mr Bernstein believes they will attract more investor interest in Hong Kong than in London or New York.', '"There aren\'t a lot of places for them to go," he said.', '"It\'s still a market that companies can go to that has deep sources of capital.

Hong Kong will continue to be one of the world\'s great cities," Mr Zeman told the BBC.', "Experts argue that China doesn't need another Shanghai or Shenzhen, successful business hubs - so far from becoming another Chinese city, Hong Kong, they say, is likely to be the capital of a Chinese-led global economic empire.
