A Russian-installed official in the southern Kherson region, Katerina Gubareva, accused Ukraine of bombing "peaceful cities with American weapons".', "Himars is far more accurate than Russia's equivalent systems and is already being credited with a string of recent attacks deep into Russian-held territory. ", 'Large areas of the Kherson region were seized by the Russians in the first weeks of the invasion, but Ukrainian forces have launched a counter-offensive while Russia has focused on its military push into Ukrainian territory in the east. Kyiv has urged residents to leave the area to escape the counter-attack.', 'Russian-appointed officials made no mention of an arms depot being hit but said instead that warehouses containing the mineral fertiliser saltpetre had exploded - a claim ridiculed by Ukrainian officials.

Russia has regularly accused Ukraine of targeting its own civilians.", 'The Russian Ria Novosti agency published footage of what it said was damaged warehouses from a humanitarian aid centre.
