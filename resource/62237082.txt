', 'Russia would now have to push Ukrainian forces further from the front line to ensure its own security, he said.', '"We cannot allow the part of Ukraine controlled by [Ukrainian President Volodymyr] Zelensky... to possess weapons that would pose a direct threat to our territory."', "The West has supplied Ukraine with increasingly powerful weapons since Russia's invasion began, including the long-range Himars missile system which has brought Ukraine some success.

', "The BBC's Anastasiya Gribanova went to see the damage caused by a Russian rocket in one of the first civilian targets in Kyiv to be hit. ", "Russia's President Vladimir Putin was keen to show he still has both friends and geopolitical influence when he flew to Iran this week for a summit with the Iranian and Turkish leaders. ", "It didn't all go to plan - his Turkish counterpart left him standing alone in front of the TV cameras for a long, awkward minute before appearing for the obligatory handshake and smiles. ", 'Nevertheless, Mr Putin received a warm welcome in Tehran, with the Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei explicitly supporting his "special operation" in Ukraine. ', 'The Syrian civil war was top of the agenda, with the Russian leader commenting that the crisis can only be solved by adhering to the "basic principles of the respect of sovereignty".

', 'Europe may be suffering intense heat at the moment, but winter is coming and a shortage of Russian gas could push energy prices even higher, including in the UK.
