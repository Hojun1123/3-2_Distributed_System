It\'s just finding interesting things, coins or artefacts."', 'He said despite the less than hospitable weather on the island during the winter months, metal detectorists were a "hardy bunch".', 'The oldest piece he has found to date was a 1,000-year-old lead Viking gaming piece with a small green glass bead embedded into the top of it.', '"It\'s not worth a lot of money, but it\'s just an interesting piece of history," he said.', '"Every now and then you\'ll find something interesting, something old, and you\'re thinking \'yes\', and that just keeps you going."', 'But, he had a reminder for anyone thinking of taking up the hobby.
