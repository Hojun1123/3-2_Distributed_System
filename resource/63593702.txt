The Congress party finds it wholly untenable," party spokesman Jairam Ramesh said in a statement.

The remaining were cleared of all charges and freed.', "Nalini's death sentence was commuted in 2000 following a clemency petition by Gandhi's widow Sonia Gandhi who had pointed out that the prisoner was pregnant at the time. ", 'In 2014, the Supreme Court commuted the death sentences of Perarivalan, Santhan and Sriharan too, citing delays in deciding their mercy pleas.', 'Tamil Nadu state government then announced its decision to free the plotters, but the federal government launched a legal challenge to stop the state from freeing them.', '"The assassination of Rajiv Gandhi was an attack on the soul of India. The release of the killers of a former prime minister of  India and our great leader, as well as several other innocent Indians, would be contrary to all principles of justice," Manmohan Singh, then the prime minister, said in a statement.
