', 'Ms Thomas said: "With rent being a vital source of income for our members, it would result in housing associations being forced to cut back on vital support services for tenants, the development of new homes, improvements to existing stock and the pursuit of net zero targets."', 'Scottish Association of Landlords chief executive John Blackwood told the committee the bill was not proportionate as his members were also affected by the cost of living crisis.', 'He said interest rates on mortgages were going up and access to mortgages was going to become a major problem for investors.', 'Mr Blackwood added: "Some existing landlords will quite frankly not be able to continue."', 'He also told MSPs he was worried about investor confidence in the private rented sector.', 'Timothy Douglas, from Propertymark, which represents letting agents, argued the plans would reduce supply and increase rents further.', 'Mr Harvie told the committee it would provide "critical temporary protection" for people who rented their homes.', 'He added: "The legislation that we are proposing will help to keep people in their homes and will help stabilise their housing costs during this extraordinary cost crisis.', '"We believe the package of measures strikes the right balance between this aim and ensuring landlords can continue to offer properties for rent and manage tenancies sustainably."', "But Scottish Conservative housing spokesman Miles Briggs said the government's plan would do little to increase the incomes of most social or private tenants.", 'He also accused the coalition of going after a "good headline" and warned the bill would have a serious impact on the delivery of new homes.', 'Mr Briggs added: "We already have a record number of people living in temporary accommodation in Scotland, and this bill has the potential to supercharge the current housing crisis." ', 'This video can not be played', 'Patrick Harvie says that evictions may still take place where there are cases of "substantial rent arrears"', 'Scottish Liberal Democrat economy spokesman Willie Rennie said including the social housing sector in the bill risked undermining housing associations, councils and charities.', 'He added: "Those homes are already subject to rent controls, so I don\'t think it would be right to impose another set of controls with a freeze."', 'Meanwhile, the Scottish Property Federation (SPF) warned the legislation would only worsen the "chronic undersupply" of rental housing across both public, private and student accommodation.', 'SPF director David Melhuish added that housing providers were not responsible for the cost of living crisis but had been "singled out" by the Scottish government\'s proposals.', 'He added: "New housing must become the policy priority, not blunt instruments singling out landlords, many of whom work hard to support their tenants." ', 'If approved, the bill will give ministers temporary power to cap rents for private and social tenancies, with this cap set at 0%.', 'It covers the period from 6 September until at least 31 March and includes the further power to maintain or vary the rent cap over two further six-month periods.', 'The bill also proposes that the enforcement of eviction actions resulting from the current economic climate will be prevented over the same period, except in a number of specified circumstances. ', 'Safeguards for both social and private sector landlords, as well as providers of college and university halls and other purpose-built student accommodation, are included in the provisions on evictions.', 'Â© 2022 BBC.
