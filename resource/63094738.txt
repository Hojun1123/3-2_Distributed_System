['<b class="ssrcss-hmf8ql-BoldText e5tfeyi3">Ways to restore the water quality of rivers running though Herefordshire are to be looked at.</b>', 'A commission enabling the county council to work with other local authorities and agencies to improve the rivers Wye and Lugg has been set up.', 'Both rivers are struggling with high levels of nutrients, mainly phosphates, which affect water quality and eco-balance, the council has said.', 'It aims to protect the wildlife habitats.', 'Both the Wye and Lugg are designated as Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and are also Special Areas of Conservation (SAC). ', 'Natural England ensures the ecology of watercourses remains in good health and sets limits for the level of nutrients. ', 'The level of nutrients in the Lugg currently exceeds these limits which has impacted on development in the area, and the River Wye is now also close to unfavourable status, the council added.', 'Agencies such as the Environment Agency, Natural England and Natural Resources Wales are responsible for the care of the rivers but struggling "to meet the demand with the considerable reduction in budgets and resources from central government", the council said.', '"We\'ve stepped up as a local authority and are working in collaboration with other agencies and neighbouring counties to develop a new plan for the Wye with clear accountability and strong governance arrangements capable of delivering restoration," said Herefordshire Council. ', 'Work on the water quality restoration is expected to be complete by March 2023. ', '"We\'re committed to doing all we can to address the issues of water quality in our rivers, to protect and enhance these important wildlife habitats," said councillor John Harrington, cabinet member for infrastructure and transport. ', 'He added: "We cannot stand by while our rivers are struggling, not just because of the impacts that restrictions have brought our precious county building industry but because we must restore the ecology and bio-diversity of our beautiful Lugg and Wye."', '<i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">Follow BBC West Midlands on </i><a href="https://www.facebook.com/MidlandsBBC/" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Facebook</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">, </i><a href="https://twitter.com/bbcmtd" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Twitter</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2"> and </i><a href="https://www.instagram.com/bbc_midlands/?hl=en" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Instagram</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">.
