', 'In its decision, the UK government said the takeover of Newport Wafer Fab created two risks to national security.', 'The first related to Nexperia\'s development of the Newport site, which the government said could "undermine UK capabilities" in producing compound semiconductors.', 'The second, the plant\'s location as part of a semiconductor cluster on the Duffryn industrial estate, could "facilitate access to technological expertise and know-how". ', 'It said the close links that existed in Newport "may prevent the cluster being engaged in future projects relevant to national security".

', 'Toni Versluijs, head of its UK operations, said: "We are genuinely shocked. The decision is wrong, and we will appeal to overturn this divestment order to protect the over 500 jobs at Newport. ', '"The decision is disproportionate given the remedies Nexperia has proposed. It is wrong for the employees, for the UK semiconductor industry, for the UK economy and for the UK taxpayer - who could now be faced with a bill of over £100m for the fallout from this decision.', '"We rescued an investment-starved company from collapse. We have repaid taxpayer loans, secured jobs, wages, bonuses and pensions and agreed to spend more than £80m on equipment upgrades. The deal was publicly welcomed by the Welsh government."', 'A government spokesman said: "The UK has a number of strengths within the semiconductor sector, including in south Wales, and through our forthcoming semiconductor strategy we will enable this technology to continue to support the UK and global economy."', 'The Welsh government said the UK government\'s decision had provided some "welcome clarity".', '"Our immediate priority now is to safeguard the future of the hundreds of highly skilled jobs in Newport," it added.', 'World Cup winner Jürgen Klinsmann invites you to subscribe to his daily World Cup newsletter.', '© 2022 BBC.
