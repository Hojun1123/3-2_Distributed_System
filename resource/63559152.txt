She said: "I love helping people, I love being there to support people, helping them through their dark times."', 'But she said while she would not leave nursing, she was reluctantly looking for work in another part of the NHS because it was "just not a nice place to work any more".', 'She said: "I\'ve never ever encountered such abuse as in the last 18 months, two years."', 'Mrs Rowberry said: "You come home to your family stressed out, upset, it takes out a great toll on nurses."', 'She said she often asked herself: "Why do I do it?"', 'The RCN, which represents about 300,000 nurses, has said any strike action would only affect nurses in non-urgent care and those needing emergency care would not be affected.
