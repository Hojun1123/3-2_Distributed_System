', 'He said a cold, dry spring had been exacerbated by difficulties getting fertiliser because of the Ukraine crisis.', '"Then once the crops started growing they\'ve had searing heat on them which has effectively burnt them off rather than ripening them - it\'s the perfect storm," said Mr Phillips.', 'His yield would be down by a third and the grain could only be good enough for animal feed rather than being sold for malting, he said.', 'The farm also grows a range of specialist crops - pumpkins for Halloween, Christmas trees and a sunflower and maize attraction - all of which are suffering due to the challenging conditions.', 'Mr Phillips said he had started taking climate change seriously many years ago because "we live and work in it, we could see what was happening".', 'The family sunk a borehole as the water supply from a ground level spring had become erratic, and they now operate their own wind turbine and solar panels to generate green energy.  ', 'But the next generation would need to build irrigation ponds to preserve water, Mr Phillips predicted.', '"The water situation is changing dramatically. When we do have storms they tend to be heavier and the water runs off instead of sinking into the ground. The ground conditions lower down are drier too - even during the winter," he explained.', "Wales' potato farmers have also been badly affected.", '"Even if we did have rain next week the plants are now starting to die off, they wouldn\'t bulk up any more so we\'re losing nigh on 50% of the crop," said Rhodri Davies, of Rosedew farm in Llantwit Major, Vale of Glamorgan.', '"There is a financial burden to that because we haven\'t got the volume of potatoes per acre to sell."', '"We\'ve been doing this now for 10 years and this has been the worst year since we started," he said.

', '"They\'ve got quite deep roots. They say a vine doesn\'t like having wet feet so this weather works really well for the vines and it means we\'re going to have a really good harvest.
