', 'Data from the internet monitoring service Netblocks shows disruptions on network operators, including state-owned Myanma Posts and Telecommunications (MPT) and an international operator, Telenor.', 'Netblocks says its findings indicate a "centrally ordered mechanism of disruption... progressing over time as operators comply".', 'By midday on Monday, internet connectivity had returned to 75% of normal activity.', 'However, on Wednesday <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-55923486" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">the military blocked access to Facebook</a>, which has been used by activists to co-ordinate opposition to the coup.', 'For the overwhelming majority in Myanmar, Facebook is the primary means of access to the internet.

', 'Magway region was reporting zero internet connectivity at one point. ', "Yangon region, which includes the country's largest city, dropped in connectivity to about 50% compared to normal times. Restricting internet in the major cities is likely to be more difficult, as users will have access to a wider variety of providers that may implement restrictions at different intensities and at different times. ", 'Most regions are now reporting an increase in internet connectivity. ', 'The Myanmar government has restricted the internet before, especially in areas in Rakhine and Chin states, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-41566561" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">where the army is fighting local groups.</a> Hundreds of thousands have been displaced by the conflicts. ', "Article 77 of Myanmar's Telecommunications Law, passed in 2013, is used by the government to cut off telecommunications during a national emergency.

', 'There were also concerns that health information about Covid-19 was being restricted to some parts of the country, because of an internet shutdown in 2020. ', 'A government can disrupt the internet by ordering internet service providers (ISPs) to limit access. ', 'This can include blocking particular sites, such as popular social media platforms. A message such as "server not found" or "this site has been blocked by the network administrator" will show up. ', 'Another method is known as "throttling" - when the bandwidth to a website is limited, making the internet slow and frustrating to use. ', 'Finally, telecoms providers can shut down all access to the internet. ', 'In theory, a telecoms company could challenge a government order. But in countries where the government has a tight grip on the media and can threaten to revoke licences, the willingness to push back on such demands is limited.
