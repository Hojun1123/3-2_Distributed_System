', 'He had earlier aired allegations of corruption against Bureau of Corrections director general Gerald Bantag, said officials. ', 'Mabasa was also an outspoken critic of former president Rodrigo Duterte.', 'Mr Bantag, who is currently suspended from duty, will "probably be the highest official of [the] land ever charged with a case of this gravity", said Justice Secretary Crispin Remulla, according to an AFP report.', 'Police have also filed a murder complaint against his deputy security officer Ricardo Zulueta. The alleged gunman, Joel Escorial, surrendered to authorities earlier in October after his face was captured from security footage. ', 'Mr Bantag and Mr Zulueta have also been accused of ordering the killing of another prison inmate, who allegedly passed on the kill order to the gunman.
