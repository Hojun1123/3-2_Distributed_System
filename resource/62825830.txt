Today, thousands of the cars run on batteries instead. And the drivers of these electric vehicles (EVs) don\'t have to worry about wasting time at charging stations, either.', 'Many electric taxis in Beijing, and dozens of other Chinese cities, just go to a battery-swapping station where a machine plucks out the depleted battery and installs a charged one in mere minutes.', '"They want to drive out there and earn some money so they definitely don\'t want to wait two hours for EV charging," explains I-Yun Lisa Hsieh from National Taiwan University.', 'This is just one facet of the increasingly diverse and booming market for electric cars in China. Members of the public are also snapping up EVs in unprecedented numbers.', 'In July, the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-09/china-s-july-car-sales-rise-20-on-demand-for-electric-vehicles#xj4y7vzkg" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">China Passenger Car Association predicted</a> that 6 million new EVs would be registered in the country in 2022 - a revision of its previous forecast of 5.5 million EVs to be sold this year.', 'Tesla had its best ever month in China in September, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-sells-record-china-made-vehicles-september-following-shanghai-factory-2022-10-09/" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">according to its most recent figures</a>, selling 83,135 cars.', 'Nearly a quarter of all cars newly registered in China <a href="https://theicct.org/2022-update-ev-sales-us-eu-ch-aug22/" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">are now electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles</a>, meaning that the country is ahead of Europe and well ahead of the US in adoption of these technologies. <a href="https://www.energyintel.com/0000017e-6d99-d79e-a57e-6fdd33390000" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Half the world\'s EVs are sold in China</a>.', 'And this is largely driven by government mandates and incentives, says Ms Hsieh. For more than a decade, the Chinese government has subsidised EV purchases. The value of these subsidies has fallen over time, and they are due to end by 2023, but there are still plenty of reasons why buying an electric car is a financial no-brainer.', 'Many buyers of new fossil fuel vehicles in China have to pay out, not only for the car, but the licence plate as well. "It\'s really expensive," says Ms Hsieh. <a href="https://cnevpost.com/2022/04/26/nevs-account-for-47-of-car-sales-in-shanghai-in-q1/" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">A new licence plate in Shanghai costs</a> nearly 100,000 yuan (£12,500; $14,000).', 'There are other perks if you opt for an EV instead, though they differ from city to city.

Firstly, will it last? And secondly, how will it shape the global EV market?', 'Ana Nicholls, director of industry analysis at the Economist Intelligence Unit, says she has been surprised at just how quickly EVs have flown out of dealerships in China lately but argues that, with the removal of subsidies for purchasers of new vehicles, the appetite for EVs could wane.', '"It\'s hard to see how the EV market can carry on expanding at quite this rate in the future," she says.', 'Charging infrastructure remains unevenly distributed and subject to supply issues - some charging stations <a href="https://jalopnik.com/china-shuts-down-ev-charging-stations-to-conserve-power-1849453761" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">were curtailed recently</a> thanks to a fall in electricity production caused by the mega drought affecting parts of China.

"In Europe, we\'re not there yet." ', "In emerging markets, these are exactly the kind of vehicles that could catch on. Time to conquer the world? Maybe. But there's another school of thought that says, well, the world can wait.", '"As long as the Chinese market is booming, they may as well just sell locally," says Ms Nicholls. "I mean, why wouldn\'t you?"', "Analysts tend to agree that it will be very interesting to see what happens when the subsidies run out. That could push Chinese EV makers towards other markets - and maybe we'll all fall in love with EVs thanks, indirectly, to the policies of Chinese authorities.
