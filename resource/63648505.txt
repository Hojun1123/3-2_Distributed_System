', 'With this email, he appears to applying that philosophy.', "He wants just true believers at Twitter, people who are fully aligned with what he's doing. ", "There are plenty of staff who do believe in Twitter's mission. There are also staff working for Twitter who will relish working closely with Mr Musk. ", 'But his directives to staff feel at times autocratic. The danger is he loses top staff by appearing cavalier and arrogant. ', "And of course, if everyone at Twitter decided to take Elon Musk's offer of severance at once, it's hard to see how Twitter could function in the short term.
