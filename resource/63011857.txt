We are at breaking point."', 'The sanctuary, based in Crawley, is 100% non-profit and relies on volunteers to keep it running. ', 'With people having to go back to paid work, the team of volunteers has decreased from 15 to five and fosterers have gone down from 12 to just one.', 'The cost of food, pet insurance and vet bills has meant shelters are struggling to cope with a rise in admissions as owners can no longer afford to keep their pets.', 'Ms Doshi said: "It is an absolutely heartbreaking situation, a lot of these people don\'t want to give up their pet but it\'s a choice between being able to feed their family, heat their home orgive up their animal.', '"For some people, especially older people, their companion animal is their only friend so the fact that they are being forced to surrender their pets just so they can stay warm this winter is just devastating."', '<i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">Follow BBC South East on </i><a href="https://www.facebook.com/BBCSE/" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Facebook</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">, on </i><a href="https://twitter.com/bbcsoutheast" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Twitter</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">, and on </i><a href="https://www.instagram.com/bbcsoutheast/" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Instagram</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">.
