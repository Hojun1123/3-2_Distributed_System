", '"Mortgage boycotts, driven by deteriorating sentiment toward property, are... a very serious threat to the financial position of the sector," think tank Oxford Economics said in a recent note.', "China's property sector makes up a third of its economic output. That includes houses, rental and brokering services; industries producing white goods that go into apartments; and construction materials.", "But China's economy has been slowing - in the last quarter it grew by just 0.4% compared to the previous year. Some economists don't expect any growth this year.", "That's largely because of Beijing's zero-Covid strategy - repeated lockdowns and continued restrictions have affected incomes and, in turn, savings and investments.", "The size of China's economy means that disruption in a crucial market - like property - can affect the global financial system.", "Experts believe contagion is the concern now - banks won't lend if they believe the sector is tanking.

', 'But many young and middle class Chinese are no longer investing in property, likely because of a weak economy, job losses and pay cuts - and now the fear that developers might not complete projects.', '"That\'s part of the problem - developers were counting on new money coming in, and those new sales are not happening anymore," Mr Evans-Pritchard said.', 'More than $220bn worth of loans could be tied to unfinished projects, according to banking group ANZ. And credit - a  major source of cash in the boom years - has also dried up. ', 'In 2020, China\'s government introduced the "three red lines" - accounting measures to limit how much developers could borrow. That cut off funding, and the subsequent lack of confidence in the market has also affected banks\' willingness to lend to property companies. ', "For one, Beijing is putting the onus on local governments - they're offering reduced deposits, tax rebates and cash subsidies to home buyers, and relief funds to developers. But this comes at a cost because local coffers will take a hit as property developers buy less land.", '"I think this is the moment for the central government and regulators to step in," Mr Ding said.

The boycott of mortgages risks becoming a serious social issue, Mr Ding said.', 'And that could become a problem for President Xi Jinping ahead of a crucial party congress later this year where he is expected to seek a historic third term.
