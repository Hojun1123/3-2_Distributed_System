', "But Russia has rejected the call, saying it no longer implements the Strasbourg court's decisions and the fate of the men was a matter for the pro-Russian, breakaway Donetsk People's Republic.", 'According to a report by Russia\'s Tass news agency, an anonymous official from the self-styled Donetsk People\'s Republic claimed Mr Healy and Mr Hill would stand trial for "mercenary activities".
