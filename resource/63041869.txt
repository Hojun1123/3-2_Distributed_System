', 'Two Tory MPs used the same analogy to describe the Chancellor\'s strategy, saying he had "put it all on red". While they were nervous about the plan, they said they hoped it would work out.

But plenty of Tory MPs fear that they don\'t, and they fear all this could mug their party of its economic reputation never for it to properly return.', 'The BBC\'s political editor says one senior Conservative figure said they were "very concerned" - and particularly about the additional cost of government borrowing.', 'They added that there was a "spectrum" of potential outcomes, ranging from "Liz Truss getting lucky, things ease on the markets, the economy grows" all the way along to "all the wheels come off, there\'s a run on the pound, a debt crisis and the UK is forced to go to the IMF". ', 'So where on the spectrum did this MP think things might end up? "Nearer to the bad end of things," they suggested.', 'And some MPs are even discussing rumours of letters to the 1922 committee (always treat these rumours with a pinch of salt, they are always swirling).', 'But many who are privately concerned are not rushing to publicly denounce the Growth Plan.
