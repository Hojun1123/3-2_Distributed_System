', 'RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said the biggest retailers should have "cut their prices more significantly on a daily basis", given the steady and consistent fall in the wholesale price of petrol.', 'He said their unwillingness to do this made July "an unnecessarily tough month for drivers".', 'However, some fuel analysts argue that is not a fair comparison.', '"Over the last eight weeks, prices have jumped around; it\'s understandable if retailers have tried to smooth those differences out in their prices," said Steve Irwin, director at Portland Analytics.', '"There is often a lag between wholesale prices dropping and a drop in prices at the pump. I expect we will see further price drops in petrol in forecourts over the next week or so of a further 5, 6 or even 7p a litre."', 'While the drop in petrol prices is good news for drivers, Mr Irwin warned it is not necessarily a good sign for the economy. ', '"The market is clearly worried about a downturn, with people cutting back this autumn and winter, and that is being factored into the wholesale price," he said.', '"If signs of that downturn don\'t materialise, prices may go back up again. If the market thinks they are, they could fall further."', '© 2022 BBC.
