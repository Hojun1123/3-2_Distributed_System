"It might be that to speed up fan entry we run a scenario looking at using stadium exits as entrances.', '"Our software can show us if that would work, or if it would cause another problem elsewhere in the stadium."', 'Mr Durden adds that stadiums can make a big difference by introducing digital tickets.', '"A lot of venues already have the capacity to do that, such as smartcard season tickets," he says.
