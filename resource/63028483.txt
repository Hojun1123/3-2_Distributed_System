Through the provisions in the Bill, I want to ensure we can continue to support and encourage our farmers and producers to create and sustain a thriving agricultural sector," she added.', 'Meanwhile England was further ahead with its own subsidy reforms which planned to reward farmers for their environmental work. ', 'But its new government has announced a review of these plans, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-63029266" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">prompting outspoken attacks</a> from the environmental sector and some farmers, though the NFU union had requested a delay.', 'NFU Cymru President Aled Jones described the Welsh bill as a "landmark moment" and the most important piece of legislation for the industry since the post-war Agriculture Act of 1947.', '"It comes at a pivotal time for society with the importance and fragility of food affordability and security, both at home and abroad, being brought into sharp focus by the effects of the devastating conflict in Ukraine.', '"This is why the bill, as a key objective, must underpin the production of a stable supply of safe, high quality, affordable food in Wales," he said.', 'Wildlife charity WWF Cymru said polling it had commissioned suggested people living in the Welsh countryside largely supported the idea of changing farm subsidy payments to help nature.', 'The poll of 1,000 residents found 60% felt only farms working to protect wildlife should receive grants in future.', 'It also found 96% of those questioned agreed that Welsh farmers had an important role to play in protecting nature, while 88% said the same for tackling climate change.', 'However only a third (34%) thought farms were already doing enough.', 'Head of communications at WWF Cymru Rhian Brewster said the survey\'s results came "at a critical moment for Wales" and gave an insight into how rural communities themselves were feeling.', '"The new Agriculture Bill gives us a once in a generation chance to set Wales on a path to a more sustainable future," she said.', '"We, along with the majority of rural Wales, want farmers rewarded for adopting climate and nature friendly, regenerative farming practices - this vital transformation can only be achieved by bold changes to agriculture payments."', '© 2022 BBC.
