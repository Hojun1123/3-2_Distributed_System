I was afraid because you have to think around corners with this stuff. ', '"And, you know, we\'ve seen knife attacks on MPs, MPs being killed, people who are prominent being attacked. So I\'m not trying to give myself undue status here, but I had to think this through."', 'Asked about the behaviour of social media giants YouTube and Twitter during the ordeal, Vine said he had been "amazed" how difficult it was to get YouTube to take action.', '"They take down individual videos and then when he\'s convicted, they demonetised him. But half the videos about me are still out there," he said.', 'Because Belfield told his viewers to copy and share the videos, they will "always be out there", Vine said, adding "I\'ve got to live with that".', '"But the fact that YouTube hosts this stuff, they have no responsibility. They don\'t care," the journalist said. ', 'He said he was "disgusted by their lack of values" and also criticised Twitter as he said Belfield still possessed an account despite being in prison.', 'Vine said Belfield had put out a video saying he was going to be back up and running.', 'He added while there were now restraining orders in eight people\'s cases he thought the one thing you could do was "deprive people of their platform".', 'The sentencing judge, Mr Justice Saini, told Belfield one of his victims had been "seconds away from taking his own life as a result of your conduct".', 'Vine told Newsnight he thought if the courts had not stopped Belfield "somebody would have died".', 'He said he feared that at some point one of the 400,000 people watching Belfield\'s videos was "going to take a knife or acid to my home".', '"The danger came from the online traffic, not from the individual," he said, adding Belfield wanted to "create so much hatred against me that someone acted by proxy". ', 'Vine said he had to take it seriously as Belfield had put his home address out.', '"I\'ve got two teenage daughters, you know, I can\'t be casual about it. So at that point I was scared for them," he said.', 'While Belfield never physically approached him, Vine said his actions had been worse than when he had had a physical stalker. ', '"That was a picnic compared to this, because what happened in this case is that you were fired on from all directions. Every time you open your phone he\'s there," he said.', 'According to YouTube, following a review several videos have been removed from Belfield\'s "Voice of Reason" channel for violating its policies.', 'A YouTube spokesperson said: "Monetisation on the Voice of Reason channel remains suspended for violating our creator responsibility policy. ', '"Our community guidelines prohibit content that threatens individuals and we have removed several videos for violating these policies."
