', 'Those with a keypad (PAYG) meter costs will see increases by around £127 per year', 'The Power NI increase is the second this year effecting 450,000 customers in Northern Ireland.

', '"So as gas prices fall, we will pass those back to the consumers," he said.', '"But at the moment they are moving up and they have moved up a tremendous amount - four times what they were, whereas we are talking about the bills only doubling," he added.', 'Mr French told the programme: "The Department for Communities and Department for the Economy, Consumer Council and ourselves are meeting regularly to see what mitigation measures can be brought forward for this winter period and I am still hopeful something can be done to help consumers coming into this winter."', 'Looking ahead to the new year, he said it may be hard to predict where prices would go.', '"Gas prices are normally about 50p - if you\'re looking out for the next 36 months the gas price prediction doesn\'t fall below the £1 mark so we are going to see high prices for the next two to three years if the market stays stable," he said.', '"Things could change - we could have a mild winter or a windy winter in terms of renewable generators and prices could come down but prices could rise if the alternative happens," he added.', '© 2022 BBC.
