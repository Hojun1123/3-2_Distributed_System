', 'He or she is elected by the members of both the houses of parliament and of the legislative assemblies of states and federally-administered union territories. ', "Ms Murmu registered a comfortable win against the opposition's candidate - veteran politician Yashwant Sinha.

She was then serving as the governor of the state of Jharkhand.', "Born in 1958 in Baidaposi village of Mayurbhanj district, Ms Murmu belongs to the Santhal community, one of India's largest tribal groups.", "Daughter of a village council chief, she studied at the Ramadevi Women's College in the state capital, Bhubaneswar.

Suddenly, she ran up onto the stage, waving her school certificate, and told the minister that she wanted to study in Bhubaneswar."', "The minister was so impressed by the little girl's enthusiasm that he ordered his staff to help her get a place in a government school in the state capital, Ms Patnaik said.

She said the salary of her husband, a bank officer, was enough to take care of the family needs," Ms Patnaik says.

Initially in-charge of commerce and transport, she later handled the fisheries and animal resources portfolios.", 'From 2006 to 2009, Ms Murmu was the president of the BJP\'s state wing for "scheduled tribes" - tribal communities recognised by India\'s constitution as socially and economically disadvantaged.', 'Her life took a tragic turn in 2009 when she lost her elder son in mysterious circumstances. A few years later, she also lost her second son and her husband.', '"She was heartbroken," Mr Satpathy said. "She would cry inconsolably whenever we\'d meet.

She held the position for six years until July 2021.', "According to BBC Hindi's Ravi Prakash in Ranchi, Jharkhand's capital, Ms Murmu won appreciation during her tenure for keeping the governor's office open to people from all walks of life.", 'On several occasions, she also made news for breaking protocol - like when she visited Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik at his home or went with a delegation to meet the railway minister to press for expansion of rail services in Mayurbhanj, her home district. ', '"Both incidents were considered violation of protocol. But she couldn\'t care less," says Rajkishore Das, her political mentor.', 'Mr Das adds that the most remarkable part of Ms Murmu\'s personality "is her equanimity in both happy and sad times and her stoicism in the face of tragedy". ', '"The way she gathered herself and continued working for the people even after multiple tragedies in her family speaks volumes about her remarkable strength of character."', 'Â© 2022 BBC.
