['<b class="ssrcss-hmf8ql-BoldText e5tfeyi3">NHS England has "never shown so much support" to stop children dying without explanation, a charity which works to prevent unexplained deaths has said.</b>', 'Sudden unexplained death in childhood (SUDC) is a rare category of death in which the cause remains unknown even after thorough investigation.', 'Currently there is very little awareness or research into its causes.', 'NHS England has said it will now begin a series of measures to change this, a move welcomed by the charity SUDC UK.', 'These include:', 'Dr Nikki Speed, from the charity SUDC UK, described the plans as revolutionary.', '"This is such positive historic progress, a landmark moment. Never has the NHS shown such support to stop sudden unexplained death in childhood," she said. ', '"Never has there been such a clear statement to review public information on SUDC, optimise data collection and learn how we could prevent future tragedies.

', '"The NHS public website still contains no basic information on sudden unexplained death in childhood, there is also no consistent medical awareness or education on this category of death. ', '"This means that if a child has died and SUDC is listed as the cause of death, today families would probably struggle to find basic information or the necessary support." ', 'The progress came following a meeting between the charity, bereaved parents Julia and Christian Rogers and Prof Simon Kenny, NHS clinical director for children and young people. ', "The measures the NHS is implementing were outlined to Mr and Mrs Rogers's local MP, Kwasi Kwarteng, after he wrote to the chief executive of NHS England, Amanda Pritchard.", 'Mrs Rogers, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-61177113" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">whose son Louis died suddenly in his sleep shortly before his second birthday</a>, said she welcomed the commitment from the NHS to transform information for SUDC parents. ', '"I have found that many medical professionals are just not aware of SUDC and its link with febrile convulsions even though it is one of the leading causes of death for children and so this will be a huge step forward," she said.', '"We are quick to talk about the risks and safety measures for children when it comes to road safety, water safety and in many other aspects of life which have a far lower death toll than SUDC. ', '"It has fallen in the gap because it\'s not high profile enough or fully understood and this must change."', '<i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">If you have been affected by the issues raised in this story, help and support is available via the </i><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/actionline" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">BBC Action Line</a>', 'Follow BBC London on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BBCLondon" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/BBCLondonNews" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Twitter </a>and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bbclondon/?hl=en" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Instagram</a>.
