She will continue in the post during a notice period of up to three months.', 'No explanation has been given for the departure of lead counsel Douglas Ross KC and three of his staff. ', 'Asked about the progress of the inquiry, Prof Watson told BBC Radio\'s <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/live:bbc_radio_scotland_fm" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Good Morning Scotland</a> programme: "It\'s going nowhere."', 'He added: "It is extraordinary, to say the least, for people such as counsel to the inquiry and others to resign their post and leave. ', '"Most lawyers would find ways to work round any perceived difficulties but for lawyers to say they will no longer accept instructions – quite extraordinary."', 'The lawyer warned the lead counsel would be difficult to replace because they were "particularly eminent - at the top of their particular branch of the law". ', 'Prof Watson said: "When you lose somebody like Douglas Ross, you\'re asking another eminent [KC] to come forward, give up two or three years of their practice to do nothing else but this inquiry and when they finish it, I mean, they won\'t have any practice left."', 'Asked who would want to replace the lead counsel, Mr Watson replied: "In my vote no-one. It\'s a hospital pass."', 'He explained that a replacement judge would also be "difficult to get". ', '"Whatever happens, even in a best-case scenario, delay is inevitable," the lawyer said.', 'He added: "Some explanation will be necessary.

", 'Deputy First Minister and Covid-19 Secretary John Swinney told the programme he was "actively involved" in recruiting a new chairperson and was holding talks with the Lord President. ', '"I want to progress to a conclusion on that as quickly as I possibly can do," he said.

And I think that\'s a point that parliament has to be mindful of."', 'Lady Poole has offered to assist her successor at the inquiry while serving her notice period.', 'A spokesperson for the inquiry said: "The Scottish Covid-19 inquiry began its important work on behalf of the public earlier this year and is continuing that work pending the appointment of a new chair.', '"The independent inquiry\'s focus has been on gathering evidence before holding oral hearings. The inquiry commissioned academic reports on aspects of the devolved strategic response to the pandemic, which were published on its website in June, when its terms of reference were finalised. ', '"In addition, the inquiry has issued \'do not destroy\' letters to organisations and individuals, is reviewing core participant status applications, and has made orders under its statutory powers to obtain relevant information from the Scottish Government."', '© 2022 BBC.
