Somebody is going to lose and indeed somebody may suffer some harm, if that is the outcome."', 'Sir David criticised the lack of political will and the failure of previous power-sharing executives to take the tough decisions required to improve public services. ', '"There has been an enormous body of work done here to identify what needs to be done to improve our public services, particularly health and education," he said.', '"We know what needs to be done. The reality is we haven\'t gone and done it. I think, by and large, that has been an absence of political will. ', '"There has been an absence of collective agreement at the executive that we will do the difficult things.', '"This for me is the really big issue that needs to be resolved. We need to find some way that we can get the decisions that are necessary to improve our services and allow us to live within our budget as well."', 'The <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p0dgn710" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">full episode</a> is available now on BBC Sounds.', '© 2022 BBC.
