', '"On an annual basis, current government policy is forcing approximately 5,000 of our school leavers to seek university places outside of Northern Ireland and less than a third of that figure return," he added.', '"By 2030, this number is expected to rise to 10,000.', '"Therefore, we need to significantly invest in skills to make Northern Ireland a more attractive place to live and work, and we welcome the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee\'s timely proposals, in particular the call for partnership."', '© 2022 BBC.
