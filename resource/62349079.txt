My pessimistic view always says that decreasing prevalence of infection is not the same as low prevalence and it\'s still very high in our communities, but none the less, this is a positive sign in the right direction.', '"It\'s actually quite a sharp decrease [in Scotland] this week. We\'re talking about one in 19 versus one in 15 last week.
