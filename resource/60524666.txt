There are also allegations that Deripaska bribed a government official, ordered the murder of a businessman, and had links to a Russian organized crime group."', 'Andrey Kostin, president of the Russian state-owned VTB bank, has also been sanctioned in the US since April 2018 and was sanctioned by the EU on 23 February 2022.

Even if a licence was granted the sanctioned individual might still find that there was no bank prepared to carry out the transaction.', 'Nigel Kushner, from W Legal Ltd, who advises people targeted by sanctions, says legal challenges "should be very carefully thought out because they may backfire", because unless there was no basis whatsoever for the sanctions, a successful challenge might just lead to the "person being designated again but this time with mountains of appropriate evidence in support". ', 'It is also possible that if the government lost in the courts it could pass legislation to allow the sanctions to continue.', 'Legal expert Prof Kern Alexander says it is "sensible" for the foreign secretary to review the cases against certain Russian oligarchs because UK human rights and other laws guarantee the rights of individuals and companies.', 'The government has to give the individuals and companies prior notice that the sanctions will be imposed, and they have to be given the opportunity to be consulted, and to contest, the proposal.  It also needs evidence to show how the sanctions relate to the policy of stopping the Russian invasion of Ukraine. ', 'Prof Alexander says the individuals can argue that "they do not have any influence with President Putin (or even that they do not know him) and that their wealth does not relate or support the Russian army or war machine and that imposing sanctions on them will not contribute to stopping or inhibiting Russian\'s invasion of Ukraine".', 'There have been examples of sanctions being overturned in the courts.
