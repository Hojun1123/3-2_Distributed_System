', 'Ms Coutinho said: "I was right, because apparently he signed the organ donor register four times. ', '"I just felt that he would not want his organs not to help other people. What\'s the point of them not helping other people, it wasn\'t going to bring Alex back to us.

', '"I never dreamt I\'d be in that position, I never dreamt that day would come. It does help if you are aware that is what your your loved one would want and I think it\'s an important conversation to have."', 'It follows a <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-57163433" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">change in the law in England</a>, which means that all adults are seen as willing to donate their organs, unless they opt out or are in one of the excluded groups.', 'However, many do not realise that families will still be approached before any donation goes ahead.
