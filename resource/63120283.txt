['<b class="ssrcss-hmf8ql-BoldText e5tfeyi3">The government has dropped its plan to abolish the 45% rate of income tax after Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng acknowledged that it was proving a "massive distraction".</b>', 'Mr Kwarteng announced a series of tax cuts and changes in his mini-budget on September 23, before performing the U-turn. The government has not said how they will be paid for. ', 'So how many people will benefit from them and how much will they cost? ', 'The top rate of income tax for those earning more than £150,000 a year was reduced from 50% to 45% by then Chancellor George Osborne from April 2013.', 'A decade on, the rate was to have been abolished in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, leaving top earners paying the 40% rate instead. Mr Kwarteng has confirmed that this will not now go ahead.

The costings in the first few years of the policy were uncertain because of wealthy taxpayers being expected to move their earnings between years to take advantage of the cut.', 'Scotland has a different system of income tax <a href="https://www.mygov.scot/income-tax-rates-and-personal-allowances" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">rates and bands</a>, which is set by the Scottish Parliament.

It's important to remember that this costing - and the others - haven't been checked by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), as they would usually be for a budget.", 'A 1.25p in the pound increase in National Insurance was introduced in April 2022. It is now being reversed from 6 November.', 'It will apply throughout the UK, to about 28 million people. ', 'It also applies to employers, the government says it will affect about 920,000 businesses.', 'The cut will cost the government about £17bn a year according to its estimates, although it expects to get about £3bn of that back if employers use their cut to raise wages or profits.', 'The price at which Stamp Duty Land Tax starts to be payable on property purchases in England and Northern Ireland has doubled, from £125,000 to £250,000.', 'There is also a special rate for first-time buyers. The price at which they start paying stamp duty has gone up from £300,000 to £425,000. ', 'There were about 1.1 million residential property transactions on which stamp duty was paid in the last year.', 'The changes will cost the government about £1.5bn a year in lost tax revenue.
