This bird will go down in history."', 'She said: "To have a Blackburnian Warbler on the islands has got everyone hopping from foot to foot.', '"About 300 people came yesterday with hundreds more expected today and more over the weekend."', 'The British Trust for Ornithology confirmed this is the first time the species has ever been spotted in England, and the fourth time in the UK.', 'The previous records were on St Kilda in 2009, Fair Isle in 1988 and Skomer in 1961.', 'Ms McRobert said: "There is a great sense of adventure.', '"Bryher is quite inaccessible at low tide and we have really low tides at the moment so people have been getting on shore anyway they can, landing on beaches, using inflatables, wading in up to their waist and running around the island dripping wet trying to get to the bird.', '"It is a sexy bird.
