"Masks are encouraged but optional."', 'She added that New York is in a far stronger position as infections and hospitalisations fall.', '"It\'s always been a visible reminder that something is not normal here, and it was there for the right reason. It protected health and now we\'re in a far different place." ', 'Mask requirements are also being lifted for homeless shelters and prisons, the governor said.', 'However, masks are still required in nursing homes, hospitals and other health-care facilities licensed by the state.', 'In April, President Joe Biden decided to stop enforcing a nationwide mask mandate on public transport after a federal judge in Florida ruled the directive was unlawful, but New York decided to continue with the rule. ', 'Many New Yorkers then started ignoring the mandate despite widespread compliance early in the pandemic.', 'Janno Lieber, chief executive of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, told a news conference that it had become "more and more difficult to justify and to enforce a mask requirement as so much of the city and so many other places were opening up".

Compliance with the rule has been spotty, to put it kindly, for months. ", 'Renegades used to receive dirty looks or be given wide berths. But this week - as commuters facing renewed return-to-office calls crammed into subway cars - perhaps half of riders were masked, with people making little differentiation between masked and unmasked.', "In fact, for some, the biggest surprise of Wednesday's announcement may have been  that the mandate was still in place, when so many others have long since lapsed.", 'Whether people will return to masking voluntarily as winter sets in remains to be seen. But for now, the decision simply formalises a regime that has already been largely in place.', 'World Cup winner Jürgen Klinsmann invites you to subscribe to his daily World Cup newsletter.', '© 2022 BBC.
