Whether that would have altered the final outcome I don\'t know but certainly it would have been sensible to do that," he said. ', "The hearing heard Claire's bloods were not checked again until the evening after she was admitted to hospital. Therefore, her treatment was based on the initial test results.", 'Dr Mann confirmed that if new blood tests had been performed sooner it may have resulted in doctors changing the type of fluid given to Claire.', 'He added: "It was a significant failure but generally [at that time] electrolytes were checked on a once daily basis and, in the morning after admission, she hadn\'t been in for 24 hours so that\'s presumably why they decided to defer it or delay it for 20 hours after admission."', "The tribunal also heard that Claire's death was not referred to a coroner, despite this being something all of the doctors caring for her would have had a duty to do.", "It was also told that a letter sent to Claire's parents from the hospital in 2005 contained inaccuracies.", 'During questioning of Dr Mann, a barrister for the GMC highlighted the involvement of Dr Steen in compiling the letter which was signed by another doctor.', "Tom Forster KC said it was the GMC's case that Claire's family were given incorrect information about potential causes of her death despite these not being definitively diagnosed.", 'He also said while Dr Steen had suspected a viral cause, a pathologist who performed an autopsy on Claire confirmed he did not find evidence of this but did not exclude it as a possibility either.', 'In response, Dr Mann said tests to detect viruses in the 1990s were "quite a lot more primitive" than today.', 'The tribunal will resume on Friday when Dr Mann is due to return for further questioning.', 'Â© 2022 BBC.
