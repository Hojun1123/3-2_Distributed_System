The borehole we usually use to fill the lake is running dry," they added.', 'Amber Jackson, who works at the Taphouse Kitchen and Grill near the lake, said at one point she had to call emergency wildlife rescue teams to save a stuck goose.', '"I had a couple of ladies come in and say a goose had got stuck in the mud," she said.', '"It\'s really sludgy mud, almost like quicksand. The minute you step on that, you\'re done for, really."', 'Ms Jackson said she believed the authority should take advantage of the low water levels to try and avoid the situation happening again in the future.', '"They should take all of the water out and give it a clean and refill it back up," she said.', 'Cleethorpes Wildlife Rescue said it was monitoring conditions at the lake to decide if any of the rescued birds could be returned. ', 'Council officers were working with a fisheries company to check oxygen levels and the temperature of the water for the welfare of the fish, the NELC spokesperson said.', '"We are doing what we can to mitigate the problem until there is more rainfall to restore water levels in the lake," they added.', '<i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">Follow BBC Yorkshire on </i><a href="https://www.facebook.com/BBCYorkshire/" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Facebook</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">, </i><a href="https://twitter.com/bbclooknorth" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Twitter</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2"> and </i><a href="https://www.instagram.com/bbcyorkshire/" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Instagram</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">.
