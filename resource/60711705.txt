['<b class="ssrcss-hmf8ql-BoldText e5tfeyi3">Russia has claimed without any evidence that biological weapons are being developed in laboratories in Ukraine with support from the United States.</b>', 'It says material is being destroyed to conceal the country\'s weapons programme, but the US says this is "total nonsense" and that Russia is inventing false narratives to justify its actions in Ukraine.', 'Russia has accused the US and Ukraine of working with "pathogens of dangerous infections" in 30 laboratories across the country. Pathogens are microorganisms that can cause disease.', 'Ukraine has dozens of public health laboratories that work to research and mitigate the threats of dangerous diseases.', 'Some of these labs receive financial and other support from the US, the European Union and the World Health Organization (WHO) - as is the case in many other countries.', 'Despite Russian claims that these are "secret" labs, details of US involvement can be found on the US embassy\'s website.

', 'Gen Igor Kirillov said documents uncovered by the Russian military in Ukraine on 24 February - the day the Russian invasion started - "show that the Ministry of Health of Ukraine has set the task of completely destroying bio-agents in laboratories".', '"The Pentagon knows that if these documents fall into the hands of Russian experts, then it\'s highly likely that Ukraine and the United States will be found to have violated the Convention on the Prohibition of Biological and Toxin Weapons," he said.', 'BBC News has been unable to independently verify the documents cited by General Kirillov.', 'The WHO has told BBC News that it had advised Ukraine to destroy high-threat pathogens stored at the country\'s public health labs to prevent "any potential spills" that would spread disease among the population.  ', 'The agency said it had collaborated with Ukrainian public health labs for several years to enhance biosafety and biosecurity and help prevent "accidental or deliberate release of pathogens". ', 'The WHO did not say when the recommendation had been made nor whether it was followed. It also did not provide details of the kind of pathogens stored at Ukrainian labs. However, the US said Ukraine\'s health ministry had ordered the "safe and secure disposal of samples" after Russia\'s invasion to limit the risk in the event of a Russian military attack.', '"There are no indications that Ukrainian labs have been involved in any nefarious activity, or any research or development in contravention of the Biological Weapons Convention," says Filippa Lentzos, a biosecurity expert at King\'s College London.', 'She adds that pathogens stored at biological labs are simply bacteria and viruses, and "not blueprints or components of biological weapons".', '"The reason they are kept in secure facilities is for bio-safety, so people don\'t make themselves sick by getting access to them."', 'The documents listing destroyed pathogens which Russian officials have presented as evidence of nefarious activity at several Ukrainian labs contain no highly dangerous pathogens, microbiologist Yevgeny Levitin <a href="https://www.sibreal.org/a/eto-soznatelnaya-lozh-ekspert-o-sozdanii-biooruzhiya-v-ukraine/31746506.html" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">told Sibir Realii, a regional outlet of Radio Liberty</a>. ', '"Everything listed in the published documents are only notional pathogens, with the exception of Clostridium diphtheriae, but even that is not considered highly hazardous".', 'Gen Kirillov also claimed that the highly militarised nature of the work at Ukrainian bio-labs is confirmed by "excess number of bio-pathogens" stored there.', 'But Dr Lentzos says this argument does not follow any logical science. "The numbers don\'t really matter, you can easily grow pathogens in a lab" starting from a small sample.', '"These labs publish in openly available literature. They collaborate on many public health projects with global partners," says Brett Edwards, a senior lecturer in security and public policy at the University of Bath.', '"Devoting considerable sums of money and significant resources to conducting bioweapons research makes no strategic sense for  Ukraine given the difficulty in using them in a conflict," argues Dan Kaszeta, a former US serviceman and expert on defence against biological weapons.
