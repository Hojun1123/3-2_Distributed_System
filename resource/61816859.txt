', 'And it said the government needed to allow greater scrutiny of whether its spending achieved the desired results.', "Audit Scotland's report said the Scottish government had worked well with the UK government, councils, NHS boards and other public bodies to direct billions of pounds of Covid funding in difficult circumstances.
