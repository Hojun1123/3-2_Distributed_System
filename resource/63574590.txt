', 'After his climbdown last week when ruling out a pre-Christmas election, the secretary of state has now completed his U-turn by ditching the current 12-week window for a poll to take place.', 'Instead, he will now legislate for a "short, straightforward extension" to allow more time for the crisis to be resolved.
