He has the mental age of a baby of around six months old. ', "Mr Mitchell received PIP and his mother and carer - Nicola Clulow - received a Carer's Allowance.", 'In December, 2020, Mr Mitchell was admitted to the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle, with sepsis, multi-organ failure and pneumonia. ', 'He remained an inpatient for 185 days, before moving to a hospice.  He was discharged home in June 2022.', "Ms Clulow - communicating on her son's behalf - said benefit payments were stopped while Mr Mitchell was in hospital, which was 1.5 hours' drive from the family home.", 'During that time, hospital staff asked her to spot when Mr Mitchell was about to have a seizure, to interpret his pain, to feed him through a tube and to be available at all hours to assist with his care when asked.', 'The family said they lost more than £5,000 in benefit payments while spending about £100 per week on food and transport.', '"We have had to struggle through in order to ensure all of Cameron\'s needs are met. To meet Cameron\'s needs is not a \'choice\' - it is a requirement to keep him safe and to allow him to lead a dignified life," Ms Clulow said.', 'The family had sought a judicial review of the current regulations, but the case has been withdrawn.', 'Learning disability charity Mencap\'s head of policy, Dan Scorer, said people with profound and multiple learning disabilities (PMLD) were "more likely to fall foul of the 28-day rule".', 'Mr Scorer said the charity would continue to work with those affected to "challenge its fairness".', 'Jonathan Beebee, the Royal College of Nursing\'s professional lead for learning disability nursing, said people with PMLD had "complex unique communication needs".', '"They often rely on close relations with people who know them well to understand and interpret what they are expressing," he said.', '"These communication needs cannot be replaced by hospital staff when they are admitted to hospital, and their carers cannot stop caring. If they do their needs will likely be neglected."

He had cystic fibrosis and Duchenne muscular dystrophy, among other conditions.

Without financial support, it could be difficult for them to afford necessary services such as transport.', 'The DWP said it was possible to pay a daily rate to somebody in this position. ', 'Secondly, Ms Davies said the hospitalisation rule affected people in long-term placements in community hospitals, who were denied the same financial support as those who lived at home or in a residential facility.', 'The DWP said it was "committed to ensuring that disabled people get all the support to which they were entitled".
