So when green hydrogen becomes available, there will be more ability to expand this hydrogen business," Mr Choo added.', 'The crucial issue behind this is how much it costs to produce each of the different types of gas.', '"Green hydrogen costs more than two to three times of grey hydrogen," says Mr Heo of S&amp;P Global.', '"Currently, it\'s about $10 per kilogramme to produce green hydrogen."', 'Mr Heo says to be cost effective, the amount has to decline by 70% to around $3 per kilogramme without government subsidies.', 'But the jump in global energy prices means that "there\'s clearly some momentum on green hydrogen because it is produced from renewable energy which is detached from the high fuel prices environment," he added.', 'For example in Europe, the costs of producing blue and grey hydrogen at times <a href="https://www.rystadenergy.com/newsevents/news/press-releases/cheap-secure-and-renewable-europe-bets-on-green-hydrogen-to-fix-energy-woes/" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">increased by more than 70%</a> following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, according to the consultancy Rystad Energy.', 'If affordable green hydrogen becomes available, there are a number of industries that can benefit.', '"We can replace grey hydrogen in industries where there are no emissions-low alternatives like refining petroleum, producing fertiliser and heavy industries like steel production which require high temperatures," Mr Tengler said.', 'To be able to compete globally, South Korea has created a hydrogen alliance which more than a dozen companies have joined.', '"The hydrogen industry at the moment is like the solar industry about 20 years ago where there are few projects being developed and there is a big ambition in the market," said Mr Heo.', "Wind power is one of the keys to South Korea's green hydrogen ambitions.", 'A consortium led by Korea Maritime and Ocean University is developing a floating offshore plant to produce green hydrogen in the city of Busan.', '"What we\'re envisioning is to use electricity from wind and solar out at sea, to boil and electrolyse seawater to produce green hydrogen," Doh Deog-hee, President of Korea Maritime and Ocean University said.', 'Its advantage is its proximity to hydrogen consumers, Mr Heo said: "You can save the hydrogen transportation costs because that\'s a big, very expensive part of the hydrogen value chain."', '"But floating offshore wind costs more than $300 per megawatt hour compared to $100 per megawatt hour of using solar power so how to actually optimise the cost of producing hydrogen from this facility is a big question," he added.', 'The transition to cleaner sources of energy has always been costly.', 'When global leaders met for COP26 in November, the world was starting to face higher fuel prices due to the pent-up demand after the pandemic lockdowns.', 'For many countries it was, and still is, very tempting to go back to fossil fuels.', 'The question is whether the soaring fuel prices could be a bigger motivator for a change.', '© 2022 BBC.
