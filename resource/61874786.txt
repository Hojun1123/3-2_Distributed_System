', 'But Rolls-Royce said the offer was "fair" and "a good deal" for staff.', 'The lump sum, which was intended for junior management and shop floor staff, was due to begin being rolled out in August, starting with the 3,000 non-unionised staff before being paid to the remaining 11,000 unionised workers.', "Unite's regional secretary Paresh Patel said the union was still in negotiations with Rolls-Royce about the pay offer.", 'News of the offer emerged on Monday night, and was later confirmed by Rolls-Royce.', 'However, Unite said: "The fact that Rolls-Royce has made this announcement in the way that it has certainly in our view undermines the trade union and the negotiating position that should be between the employer and the unions on this matter."', 'Rolls-Royce had also offered workers a 4% increase in pay, back-dated to March. A Rolls-Royce spokesperson had told the BBC it would be "the highest annual pay rise for at least a decade" for its shop floor staff.

Prices are almost certainly not going to fall.', 'Yet, these payments are not embedded in future wages, unlike a regular pay increase. As employees continue to find it tough, will there be pressure on bosses to make these payments a permanent part of pay next year and beyond?', 'There is undoubtedly an awareness among businesses that workers, particularly the lower-paid, need more financial help at the moment to cover their bills.', 'But perhaps this eye-catching tactic of one-off payments is directed more at another issue - the retention and recruitment of staff.', 'Rolls-Royce was badly impacted by the global coronavirus pandemic, which hit demand for its aircraft engines as international air travel ground to a halt.
