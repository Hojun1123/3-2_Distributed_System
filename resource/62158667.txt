Businesses too are being hit by soaring input costs.', '"Wherever they can, firms are stepping-up to help by absorbing costs to keep prices down for consumers, as well as supporting their employees to cope with the cost-of-living spike."', 'Speaking to the BBC in her first broadcast interview, Mrs Graham said that calls from the government and the Bank of England that workers should not ask for high wage rises were "totally wrong" and "abhorrent".', 'Tens of thousands of members of her union were involved in disputes up and down the country, with many double digit pay rises won, for bus drivers, bin collectors, and factory workers, including in one case a rise of 23%, she said.', 'She said it was "not militant" to ask for pay rises matching or exceeding the rate that prices rise - inflation is currently running at more than 9%.', 'Last month Treasury minister Simon Clarke warned employees not to expect their wages to rise along with the soaring rate of inflation, saying <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-61846102" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">wage rises help push up the cost of living</a>.', 'His comments echoed those made earlier this year by Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey, who <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-60206564" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">warned workers to avoid asking for big pay rises</a>.', 'She denied that there was a risk of a "Seventies-style" spiral of wages and prices which would prolong the period of very high inflation, instead blaming a rise in profits at big companies.', 'Ms Graham said that employers "slashing the pay" of those who worked through the pandemic was "abhorrent".', '"I\'m just not going to allow that to happen.
