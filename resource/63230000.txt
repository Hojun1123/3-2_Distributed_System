', '"It is difficult not to envisage further pressure on the housing sector as the economy adjusts to higher interest rates and the tight labour market begins to reverse," he said. ', '"For now, mortgage arrears and possessions remain at historic lows but they are inevitably going to move upwards over the next year, as pressure on homeowners grows," he added. ', '"However, as lenders have been a lot more cautious through this cycle, with high loan-to-value mortgages accounting for a much smaller share of the lending book than in the past, this should help to limit the adverse impact on the market."', 'The Bank of England\'s <a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/credit-conditions-survey/2022/2022-q3" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">quarterly survey of banks and building societies on credit conditions </a>found that mortgage lending between July and September fell and is expected to decrease again in the final three months of the year.

', 'On Thursday, the average two-year fixed mortgage rate was 6.46%, according to researcher Moneyfacts, the highest since 2008. The average five-year fixed deal was 6.28%, also close to a 14-year high.', 'The Bank of England said many households would struggle if interest rates rose as high as the market expected them to, with it hitting both mortgage holders and renters. ', 'Currently it says around 1.7% of UK households - or 475,000 - are in a position where they are more likely to experience repayment difficulties. It defines that as having to spend more than 70% of their take-home pay on mortgage or rent and essentials.', 'But it believes that percentage will rise to 2.8% - or around 800,000 households - by the end of next year.

', '"Some may find it harder to repay debts," it added, unless they can make significant spending cuts. ', 'However, it also said households were better placed to deal with financial stress than in the past, having less debt relative to their incomes. ', 'The share of people with high loan-to-value mortgages is also much lower. ', '"This reduces the risk of them defaulting on debt and banks are now required to be flexible in their response," the Bank said.
