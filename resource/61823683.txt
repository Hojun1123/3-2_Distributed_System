', 'This period in the calendar brings with it the usual remarks from long-term sufferers: "Hay fever is worse than normal this year."', 'For Megan McWhinney, a primary school teacher from Thornton in Lancashire, this year is "the first time I have had time off work with it".', 'Megan has had hay fever for seven years and had some of her worst-ever symptoms in mid-July. ', '"My eyes were sore, red, yellow and glassy. I could not see."', "Megan's hay fever symptoms normally kick in each year in February, but this year they began at the end of June. ", '"I used to take antihistamines from February to October, but this year I stopped taking it as it was not affecting me.', '"Then three weeks ago, I started getting symptoms again. My throat was horrendous, my ears started itching.', '"There have been times where I have not wanted to leave the house."', 'And she is not alone.

I take a tablet daily and if I did not take it, it would be worse."', '<b class="ssrcss-hmf8ql-BoldText e5tfeyi3">But just how bad is it?</b>', "Dr Beverley Adams-Groom, one of the UK's leading pollen forecasters, said pollen grains may be getting more potent due to CO2 levels in the atmosphere. ", '"Pollutants from traffic can interfere with the respiratory system and reduce the threshold that people start to experience symptoms," she added.', 'A warm May with sufficient rainfall, followed up by a warm June, meant there was also good grass pollen growth and production this year, Dr Adams-Groom said.', 'Hay fever is largely treatable, but some high count days can feel unbearable. ', 'Studies show that some pollen types across Europe are already becoming more severe, with longer and earlier seasons.', '<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969722019751" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Research from Dr Adams-Groom</a> shows that climate change could be a driving factor behind changing patterns in the UK.', 'Pollen seasons for different plants and trees happen at different times of the year - broadly starting with tree pollen in mid-March, and ending with weed pollen by September.', 'Her research, exploring trends over 25 years, shows: ', '<a href="https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/weather/warnings-and-advice/seasonal-advice/health-wellbeing/pollen/when-is-hayfever-season" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">The Met Office says</a> a changing climate may lengthen the normal UK season and make concentrations higher.', 'It means people who are allergic to both tree and grass pollen could get a "double-hit" as the seasons become longer and overlap, according to Dr Sophie Farooque, hay fever expert and author of Understanding Allergy. ', '"You can end up breathing in both pollens simultaneously, rather than having a bit of a break from one to the next," she said.

', 'Developed countries, like the UK, tend to have a greater prevalence of hay fever, with higher rates in urban areas. ', 'More than half of the global population live in urban areas, and that figure is projected to climb to 68% by 2050, according to the United Nations.', 'And it is the microbiomes of these urban environments which could be changing our immune response towards pathogens including pollen, according to Professor Cruickshank.
