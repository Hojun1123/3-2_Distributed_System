They live on the land - they just go on the sea to fish."', 'The BBC is not naming the beach.', 'The BDMLR said it was important seals were allowed space on beaches to digest food and rest.', 'Older, healthy animals tended to avoid busy beaches but this was something young pups separated from their mothers had not yet learned, Ms Hardy said.', 'The mothers may also do themselves or unborn pups harm in their rush to get away from people, she added.', '"Seals throw themselves off cliffs or over rocks", she said.', 'Pups, if touched, are often rejected by their mother and are likely to bite or pass on diseases or parasites, especially to dogs.', '"They look sweet and nice and fluffy with the big sad eyes but they\'re a wild animal and, if cornered, their only way to defend themselves is to bite," Ms Hardy said.', '<i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">Follow BBC North East &amp; Cumbria on </i><a href="https://twitter.com/BBCNEandCumbria" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Twitter</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">, </i><a href="https://www.facebook.com/bbcneandcumbria" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Facebook</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2"> and </i><a href="https://www.instagram.com/bbcneandcumbria/" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Instagram</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">.
