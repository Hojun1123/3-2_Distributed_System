The universities argue they care, but they don\'t have a legal duty of care, it\'s some sort of moral duty."', 'Natasha had social anxiety disorder, which made it difficult for her to speak in front of people, and she killed herself on the day she was due to give a presentation in a large lecture theatre.', 'Her parents took legal action against the University of Bristol under two types of law - the Equality Act 2010 and also the law of negligence.', 'They were <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-nottinghamshire-61510479" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">able to win their claim under the Equality Act</a> because Natasha\'s social anxiety disorder was classed as a disability, and the judge ruled the university had not made reasonable adjustments in the way she was assessed as part of her course.', 'However, they lost the negligence part of their case, because the judge was not satisfied that the university owed Natasha a duty of care. <a href="https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Abrahart-v-Uni-Bristol-judgment-200522.pdf" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">His judgement</a> noted that "there is no statute or precedent which establishes the existence of such a duty of care owed by a university to a student".', 'This is why the Abraharts want new legislation, in order to protect students who are not already protected under the Equality Act.', 'Their solicitor, Gus Silverman, said the judgement in Natasha\'s case highlighted "the lack of legal protections for students who don\'t benefit from the Equality Act".', '"As the law presently stands it is difficult to hold a university legally accountable where it has caused a student harm by behaving unreasonably, unless the student was disabled and the claim meets the Equality Act\'s procedural requirements," said Mr Silverman.', '"It seems very strange that if a school owes a duty to act with reasonable care and skill in relation to its pupils that a university shouldn\'t owe a similar duty to its students, particularly when universities, including the University of Bristol, regularly claim publicly that they do owe that kind of duty."', 'Universities UK, which describes itself as the "collective voice" of 140 universities, is cautious about changing the law.', '"UUK does not believe that a statutory duty of care is necessary, as universities are already subject to health and safety regulations and duties under the Equality Act," a spokesperson said.', '"Universities go beyond their legal requirements to prioritise the mental health and wellbeing of their staff and students, to provide support services for those in difficulty, and to work closely with NHS services.', '"If additional legal duties are to be placed on universities, above what is required in other adult work or education settings, it needs to be accompanied by better mental health care across the health service and additional funding."', 'On Thursday, Universities UK <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-63075852" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">announced new "information sharing" guidance</a> which aims to prevent student suicide.', '<a href="https://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/sites/default/files/uploads/Reports/uuk-papyrus-suicide-safer-universities-sharing-information.pdf" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Under the guidance</a>, universities are being asked to contact key family members, carers or friends if they have serious concerns about a student\'s mental health.', 'However, the Abraharts are concerned that institutions may not take up the recommendations, because there is no legal requirement to follow them.', '<a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/articles/estimatingsuicideamonghighereducationstudentsenglandandwalesexperimentalstatistics/2017to2020" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Official estimates suggest</a> 64 students killed themselves in England and Wales in the 2019-20 academic year.', 'Hilary Grime, whose daughter Phoebe <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/mother-pays-tribute-phoebe-grime-23504348" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">killed herself while studying at Newcastle University</a>, is among the parents campaigning for new legislation.', '"All this time that\'s passing is more students taking their own lives," she said.', '"This is every parent\'s worst nightmare.
