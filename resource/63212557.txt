He hopes that oil palm will help him return to profit. He says at least 50 other farmers in his village have made the same switch recently.', "They are part of a growing number of farmers who are joining the state's ambitious plan to become India's palm oil hub. Since 2014, the land under palm oil cultivation here has grown from 34,000 acres to 72,000 acres in 2022.", 'The farmers are inspired by the huge profits made by plantation owners like Narayana Rao. Mr Rao, who is from the neighbouring Andhra Pradesh state, began cultivating oil palm eight years ago on his 30-acre (12.14-hectare) field in Khammam and says he has made a profit of more than 4m rupees ($48,705; £43,802).', '"The lifespan of an oil palm crop is roughly 30 years. I am 72. I don\'t think I\'ll uproot these plants in my lifetime," he says. ', 'The oil palm is considered a "wonder crop" and is used in nearly every product of daily use - from food items like chocolates, ice-cream, bread and butter to cosmetics. It is also used as a biofuel component in diesel and petrol and has a variety of industrial applications. ', 'In India, it accounts for 60% of the cooking oil market. The country produces just 2.7% of its needs, less than 300,000 metric tons of palm oil, and .imports 90% of its requirement - about 10 million metric tons - <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-61229607" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">from Indonesia and Malaysia</a>. ', 'The Telangana government under Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao has been promoting the crop by offering generous subsidies to farmers - the state has allocated 10bn rupees this year alone to encourage its cultivation.', 'The state plans to grow the area under oil palm cultivation by another two million acres and the number of farmers from 6,500 to 35,000 in the next four years.', 'Director of state\'s horticulture department Venkat Reddy said earlier this year that Telangana would then become "the fifth largest oil palm cultivator [in the world]".', '"Our aim is to be the state that can supply enough palm oil so that imports from Malaysia and Indonesia are reduced by 30-40%."', "Analysts say this could benefit millions of households and also reduce the country's dependence on oil imports to meet domestic requirements. ", 'But environmental experts are sceptical. The crop is considered a major driver of deforestation. Globally, almost all oil palm is grown <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27462984/" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">on lands that were once biodiverse tropical forests</a>, studies have shown.

", 'It will also use 25%-30% less water than paddy, reducing the government expenditure on electricity subsidy, says Kranthi Kumar Reddy, general secretary of the National Oil Palm Farmers Association. ', '"In terms of productivity, more oil can be extracted from palm oil compared to other oil seeds," says trade analyst Narasimha Murthy. "It\'s possible to get 5,000kg per hectare." ', "But farmers' welfare organisations are sceptical of these plans, particularly the cost of watering a crop that requires expensive lift irrigation all year round.", '"The summers in the state are too hot for this crop," says Ravi Kanneganti, general secretary of independent farmers\' organisation Rythu Swarajya Vedika. ', 'Oil palms need moisture in the air and most of Telangana has dry land that does not receive adequate rainfall, says Dr Ramanjaneyulu, the executive director of Centre for Sustainable Agriculture.', '"Telangana spends a lot of money to bring river water to these farm lands through lift irrigation. How long will the government bear the cost of this?" he adds.', 'It is also not enough to give subsidies for cultivation. Experts say the government needs to offer a minimum support price (MSP) - a guaranteed minimum price for the produce - to farmers.', 'Many farmers in Andhra Pradesh, which is currently the country\'s largest producer, shifted from crops like rice, coconut and bamboo to oil palm when the federal government first pushed the crop in the 1990s.
