"So it has to be cleared up whether, voluntarily or involuntarily, there has been a misappropriation of either the sanctions or of the energy produced by any company, French or otherwise."', 'According to Le Monde newspaper, liquid gas condensate from the Termokarstovoye field in Siberia has been converted by a refinery in Omsk into kerosene used as jet fuel by Russian bombers. <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2022/08/25/how-french-oil-giant-totalenergies-fuels-russian-fighter-jets-in-ukraine_5994692_4.html" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">The paper\'s allegations were based on an investigation by NGO Global Witness.</a>', "The fuel supplied Sukhoi jets that bombarded Mariupol, it reported, in particular the 16 March attack on the Ukrainian city's theatre where some 600 people were killed.", 'TotalEnergies not only owns almost half the gas field, <a href="https://totalenergies.com/media/news/press-releases/russia-termokarstovoye-gas-field-brought-stream-northern-siberia" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">it also owns more than 18% of the Russian firm Novatek</a>, which controls the rest of it.
