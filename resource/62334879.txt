', '"We need expert help and that\'s why we\'ve approached the WHO who are helping us with psychological help." ', 'Ms Zelenska, who is known for being quite private, also discussed her recent appearance in Vogue. She said it was a massive opportunity to speak about Ukraine. ', '"Millions read Vogue and speaking to them directly was my duty. And that was an interesting experience," she said.  ', '"In peaceful life, I\'m not used to attention. Everyone is fighting on a front line and it\'s work and I have to do that work," she added.', 'Last week Ms Zelenska hosted a First Lady summit, attended by the spouses of a number of world leaders. During the meeting, they discussed the Ukraine war and the assistance needed.  ', '"First ladies have no opportunities to influence politically but we have an emotional influence.

There is no life without development - we have to keep developing." ', 'World Cup winner Jürgen Klinsmann invites you to subscribe to his daily World Cup newsletter.', '© 2022 BBC.
