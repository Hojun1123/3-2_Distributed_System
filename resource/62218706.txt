', 'James Reed, chairman of Reed, one of the UK\'s largest recruitment businesses, said the UK was seeing "a two-speed workforce", with big pay offers being made to people with certain skills. ', '"So you might be seeing 25% plus pay offer increases to get people to move jobs. But then we\'re seeing other parts of the economy where pay hasn\'t moved much at all and that is concerning because more and more people will end up living in in-work poverty," he told the BBC\'s Today programme. ', 'Virgin Money is the latest company to offer a one-off payment to help employees cope with the rising cost of living, with all staff on a salary of £50,000 or less to get a £1,000 lump sum in August. ', 'Firms including Lloyds Bank have also offered similar payments. ', 'With job vacancies at near record highs, many sectors are struggling to recruit.', 'Max Poynton, operations director at Project D, a doughnut firm in Derby, said it was particularly hard to find experienced people. ', '"I think a lot of people after the pandemic have gone and retrained, upskilled themselves and the same pool of people that was there before maybe isn\'t there anymore."', 'He knows staff are struggling, with some ride-sharing on their way into work to save money. Some have asked directly for a pay rise but with the business facing increased costs on everything from electricity to diesel to flour and icing, he says it is simply not an option.', '"I\'d love to be able to say yes but at the moment it\'s tough to offer any sort of pay rises, especially with the uncertainty of not knowing how much our costs are going to increase over the next six months."', 'Dan Bond, who works in the doughnut factory, said his last pay rise was in April when the minimum wage went up. Since then Dan, who drives to work, has seen a huge rise in the cost of filling up his tank. ', 'However, he is unsure whether he would ask his employer for a pay rise.

', 'But Frances O\'Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, told the committee workers were facing a "pay crisis" and the argument that the country was in a "pay inflation spiral" was "nonsense". ', 'The jobs market is still hot, with unemployment down and vacancies up near records. However, the ONS says it doesn\'t see evidence of the dreaded "wage-price" spiral that would entrench the current high rates of inflation. ', 'Indeed the flip side of that is the biggest real squeeze on pay since these records were first collected two decades ago, and probably for significantly before that too.', 'Pay settlements are not "inflationary" as they are not exceeding inflation. Though there is some evidence in certain sectors and local settings, with worker shortages, of unionised workplaces securing double digit pay rises. ', 'Other workplaces in construction and manufacturing see employers paying retention bonuses and cost of living lump sums. On average, while not inflationary, these settlements are high in cash terms.', 'It is notable too that from March to May, average total pay including bonuses was up 7.2% in the private sector compared to the previous year, but up just 1.5% in the public sector.
