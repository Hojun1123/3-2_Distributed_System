', '"We now have an opportunity to explore these issues in the context of whether the current structure really is the best system to deliver on these shared priorities."', 'There has been concern that disadvantaged pupils in particular lose progress over the long summer break.', 'Some have argued that adding holidays at other times in the year would help refresh staff and pupils.', 'The report for the government showed pupils favoured the longer break and researchers said more work would be needed on the impact of any change on exam timetables.', 'Concerns in the tourism industry that reducing the summer break would have "serious consequences" for an important economic sector should also be addressed, they said.', 'Head teachers\' representatives have questioned why the minister wanted to push ahead with reforms in view of research which showed "no great appetite" for change.', 'Eithne Hughes, director of the Association of School and College Leaders Cymru, said there were "many more pressing issues" such as funding teacher shortages, education recovery following the pandemic and the launch of a <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-61787090" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">new curriculum</a>.

", 'She said: "Those who identified current arrangements as their preference were presented with a series of alternative options with no choice of retaining the status quo, the key question is how changing term times would improve outcomes for learners. This remains unanswered."', 'Ms Doel said evidence available showed countries with longer summer breaks than Wales had higher attainment levels.', 'NEU Cymru said the majority of its members were concerned about the plans.', 'Its Wales secretary David Evans said: "We believe it is really important the Welsh government speak to the education workforce about their concerns.
