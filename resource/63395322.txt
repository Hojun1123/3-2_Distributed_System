', 'It is not clear how Cape Town officials plan to stop the vessel - called The Nord - from docking.', 'A spokesman for President Cyril Ramaphosa said: "South Africa has no legal obligation to abide by sanctions imposed by the US and EU." ', '"South Africa\'s obligations with respect to sanctions relate only to those that are specifically adopted by the United Nations," the spokesman, Vincent Magwenya, noted.', 'Accusing Mr Geordin Hill-Lewis of "grandstanding", he added: "Municipal governments have no legal control over the country\'s borders."', "Hong Kong's government recently offered similar justifications when refusing to prevent the entry of the $521m (£472m) superyacht, with Chief Executive John Lee saying the city would be accountable to UN sanctions.
