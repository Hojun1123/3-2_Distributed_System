This will be a concern for many parents and carers of young children, and we urge them to take up the offer of vaccination for eligible children as soon as possible."', 'Experts use several measures to monitor flu, including reporting from GPs and the general public, as well as tests done in hospitals and in other healthcare settings. ', 'In the week ending 16 October, the hospital admission rate for confirmed cases of flu was nearly one per 100,000 people - more than seen in recent years for mid-October, suggesting the flu season has come early. The rate is still relatively low overall. Cases were highest among young children, followed by adults over 85.

', 'Dr Ramsay said: "It\'s possible that we\'re already seeing the benefits from so many people taking up their Covid autumn booster in England. Encouragingly, the latest data shows a small decrease in Covid cases and hospitalisation rates over the past week.
