Chief Constable Pam Kelly said none of the allegations were available to them at the point he was re-employed.', "Mr Jones' wife Sharon and daughter Emma, whose names have been changed, said although he never caused them physical harm, he made Sharon sleep on the sofa, and controlled every aspect of life in the house.", 'Emma said her mother protected her and her sisters.', '"My mam normally received the brunt of it, if we did anything wrong it was my mam\'s fault, if anything went wrong in his life it was my mam\'s fault," she said. ', '"For a long time my mam stood between him and us.', '"He would keep her sleep deprived, she didn\'t have a room on her own, my dad made her sleep on the sofa, he had the master bedroom so he could wake her up whenever he wanted, she still had to work, she still had to give him money every month," she said.
