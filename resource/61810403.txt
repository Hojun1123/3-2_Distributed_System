", "The rise of smartphones then arguably delivered the fatal blow, with Apple's pre-installed Safari browser and Google Chrome on Android phones helping to shift internet access and usage into the mobile realm. ", 'Mobile and tablet internet usage overtook desktop worldwide for the first time in October 2016, according to independent web analytics company <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/press/mobile-and-tablet-internet-usage-exceeds-desktop-for-first-time-worldwide" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">StatCounter</a>.
