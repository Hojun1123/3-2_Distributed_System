Before the pandemic, up to 125,000 people a day departed from the airport.', 'The BBC has seen a letter from the Civil Aviation Authority, which regulates airports, to Heathrow asking airport bosses to explain - by midday on Friday - why it has introduced a passenger cap and what it means for each terminal.', 'Thousands of UK travellers have been affected by disruption in recent weeks, with many having to deal with last-minute flight cancellations.', 'The UK is about to enter the key summer holiday season as schools begin to break up and there are concerns travellers will be hit by further disruption and delays to journeys.', "Emirates is clearly furious. While airlines haven't always enjoyed a smooth relationship with Heathrow, arguing over charges for example, this is in a different league.", "Accusing the airport operator of incompetence, blatant disregard for consumers, creating a mess that airlines and passengers have to sort out... it isn't pulling any punches here.", "Emirates is in a difficult position. It relies on carrying large numbers of passengers in big planes from London to Dubai, where most of them fly on to other long-haul destinations. So every flight cut matters - and Emirates thinks it shouldn't have to cut them. ", "It isn't the only airline saying this sort of thing, either.

"All the signals of a strong travel rebound were there."', 'The airline said that as international travel had recovered over the past year, it had rehired and trained 1,000 pilots.
