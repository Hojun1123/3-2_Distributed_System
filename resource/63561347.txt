She would also go to the Stotfold Social Club and worked manufacturing souvenirs on an industrial estate in Henlow, Bedfordshire.', 'In 1973, she relocated to Cambridge to study at a language school and the couple did not see her again.', 'David Grimstead, founder and chief executive of Locate International, said the woman "lived a full life and enjoyed the company of others".', '"So it\'s hard not to think of the people who missed her when she seemingly vanished," he said.', '"No piece of information is too small to share - it can provide new clues, or new lines of enquiry that could prove crucial."', 'A spokesman for Hertfordshire Police said: "The case remains open and we would be keen to hear from anyone who may be able to provide fresh information concerning this person.
