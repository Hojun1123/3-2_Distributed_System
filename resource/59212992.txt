The heat is then used to boil water, producing steam which drives turbines and generates electricity.', "Unlike burning fossil fuels, this process doesn't produce greenhouse gas emissions, and requires minimal use of metals or other natural resources. But it does generate hazardous waste which must be stored for a very long time.", 'There are currently six plants that can supply about 20% of UK electricity demand, with 15% generated in 2020.

", "Although this is much lower than current prices - which have soared to £195 per megawatt hour due to the energy crisis - critics argue it's still too much.", 'Over the last five years, the price has been between £25 and £50 per megawatt hour, so if prices return to this level it would make nuclear power very expensive.
