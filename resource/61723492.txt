We did not know much about the virus. We did not know much about exactly how it spread. We did not know there were going to be vaccines and treatments."', 'Asked about the Partygate scandal, he said: "It was really important at all stages that everyone stuck to the rules. It works when people stuck to them. It is disappointing that that wasn\'t the case."', 'His comments come the day after Prime Minister Boris Johnson survived a confidence vote triggered by Tory MPs angry at <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-61578730" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">staff partying in Downing Street</a> while the UK was in lockdown.
