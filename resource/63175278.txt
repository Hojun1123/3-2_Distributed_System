"So my dad, being an engineer, was a bit like, \'We\'ll just make one\'."', "He has played with the National Children's Orchestra, National Youth Orchestra and the National Youth Brass Band, and is currently studying at the Royal Birmingham Conservatoire. ", 'Ashman was lost for words when his victory was announced, but managed to thank his family and friends in the audience.

', 'Describing the winner, she added: "Jordan Ashman\'s performance started not with loud, flashy playing, but with exquisite, gentle beauty. ', '"He held the entire room throughout that delicate opening and kept that magic through his whole performance. Jordan combined emotional expression with an easy, assured technique, and moments of brilliance that made all of us catch our breath."', 'Ashman is only the third percussionist to win the biannual Young Musician competition, after Adrian Spillet in 1998, who is now principal percussionist of the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra; and Fang Zhang, who won the 2020 title in May last year, after the original final was delayed due to the pandemic.
