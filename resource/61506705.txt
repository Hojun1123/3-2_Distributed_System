', 'The scientists were able to use individual spans of cable between repeaters - devices that help boost the signal - as separate sensors.', '"If we apply this technique to a large number of cables", Dr Mara said, "we could transform this underwater infrastructure into a giant array of detectors for earthquakes, ocean currents and more. ', '"Extending the seismic network from land to the seafloor will improve our understanding of the internal structure of the Earth and its dynamic behaviour" he added.', 'Cable-based sensors could identify the "epicentral area" of an earthquake in the same way as land-based seismometers, the researchers suggest.', 'And the technique opened other possibilities, such as monitoring deep-water currents for changes caused by global warming.', 'There is also the untested possibility of using cables to monitor how climate change alters sea-floor temperatures.', 'Technology-giant Google was involved in the research as well as the University of Edinburgh, the British Geological Survey, and the Istituto Nazionale di Ricerca Metrologica, in Italy.', "Brian Baptie, head of the Earth seismology team for the British Geological Survey, said the research could transform scientists' ability to make measurements over vast areas of Earth's surface where it was very difficult to use conventional technologies. ", '"It creates an amazing opportunity to observe earthquakes in the middle of oceans at close range as well as the tantalising possibility of measuring other natural phenomena like submarine volcanic eruptions and tsunami in future," he said.', 'World Cup winner Jürgen Klinsmann invites you to subscribe to his daily World Cup newsletter.', '© 2022 BBC.
