These have weakened slightly to around 60mph and Nicole has been downgraded to a tropical storm as it makes its way north-west across the sunshine state.", 'Since the storm hit in the early hours, more than 600,000 homes and businesses have lost power. Electricity has been restored to around half of these but 308,000 remain without, according to service providers.', 'The storm is expected to weaken further as it heads north towards Georgia and the Carolinas, over the next two days.', 'Its remnants could possibly even hit Ohio, Pennsylvania and New York later in the week.', "Most of Florida's 22 million residents remained under a tropical storm, high wind and storm surge warnings along with local hurricane statements that urged people to stay indoors and watch for flooding.", "Forty-five of the state's 67 counties are under a state of emergency and four counties are under mandatory evacuation orders.", 'The NHC has warned of flooding caused by wind-driven waves washing inland into low-lying areas, and said strong winds were likely to blow down trees and power lines.
