It normally applies to the exchange of goods, but occasionally to services as well.', "Making trade cheaper is usually achieved by reducing or eliminating tariffs. These are government taxes or charges for trading goods across borders. A car importer might have to pay a 20% tariff on top of the vehicle's price, for example, to bring it into a country.", 'Trade can also be made simpler if countries have the same rules, such as the colour of wires in plugs or food safety requirements. The closer the rules are, the less likely that goods need to be inspected. ', "While free trade agreements aim to boost trade, too many cheap imports could threaten a country's own manufacturers. This could affect jobs.", 'For that reason, a government might choose to put tariffs on certain things. Tariffs on car imports, for example, could help protect local car makers from cheaper vehicles coming in from abroad.', 'Since it left the EU, the UK has had the freedom to pursue it own independent trade deals. ', 'Most recently it <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/uk-new-zealand-free-trade-agreement" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">signed a deal</a> with <b class="ssrcss-hmf8ql-BoldText e5tfeyi3">New Zealand</b> on 28 February 2022.

At the time the UK left, the EU had about 40 trade deals covering more than 70 countries.', 'The UK government says it has secured <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/uk-trade-agreements-with-non-eu-countries" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">rollover deals with 69 of the original countries</a>.', 'After Brexit happened on 31 January 2020, the UK and EU needed to decide the rules for their future trading relationship.', "This was important because the EU is the UK's largest and closest trading partner.", 'After months of negotiation - which went down to the wire - a UK-EU trade deal came into force on 1 January 2021.', 'The deal prevented any tariffs and quotas being introduced - which would have made it more expensive to trade between the two partners.', 'But not everything is the same as it was before Brexit. ', 'As the UK no longer has to follow EU rules on product standards, new checks have been introduced. ', "The deal also does not completely eliminate the possibility of tariffs in future. Both sides will need to stay close to shared rules in areas like workers' rights and environmental protection.
