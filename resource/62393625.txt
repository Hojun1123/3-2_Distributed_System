I can\'t start my life properly."', 'He worked alongside the British Army in Afghanistan and came to the UK with his wife and two young children after Afghanistan fell to the Taliban in August last year. ', 'He says his wife of 20 years is struggling after sharing one hotel room between the four of them since September.', '"I don\'t blame her [for struggling] because I know the situation.
