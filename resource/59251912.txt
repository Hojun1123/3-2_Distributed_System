", "In recent months, we've seen a new version of this argument. ", 'Thousands of posts on social media, reaching hundreds of thousands of people over the past year, claim a "Grand Solar Minimum" will lead to a natural fall in temperatures, without human intervention.', 'But this is not what the evidence shows.

', 'Heat which would normally be released into the stratosphere is being trapped by greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide from people burning fuel.', 'If temperature changes on Earth were being caused by the Sun, we would expect the whole atmosphere to warm (or cool) at the same time.', 'Various posts circulating online claim global warming will make parts of the earth more habitable, and that cold kills more people than heat does.', 'These arguments often cherry-pick favourable facts while ignoring any that contradict them. ', "For example, it's true that some inhospitably cold parts of the world could become easier to live in for a time. ", 'But in these same places warming could also lead to extreme rainfall, affecting living conditions and the ability to grow crops, ', "At the same time, other parts of the world would become uninhabitable as a result of temperature increases and rising sea levels, like the world's lowest-lying country, the Maldives.

Any small local benefits from fewer cold days are expected to be outweighed by the risks of more frequent spells of extreme heat.', 'A common claim made by those against efforts to tackle climate change is that fossil fuels have been essential to driving economic growth.', 'So limiting their use, the argument goes, will inevitably stunt this growth and increase the cost of living, hurting the poorest.', "But this isn't the whole picture. ", 'Fossil fuels have powered vehicles, factories and technology, allowing humans over the past century to make things at a scale and speed which would previously have been impossible. This enabled people to make, sell and buy more things, and become richer.', "But stopping using coal doesn't mean returning to the days of ox-drawn carts and hand-cranked machines - we now have other technologies that can do a similar job. ", 'In many places, renewable electricity - powered by wind or solar energy for example - is now cheaper than electricity powered by coal, oil or gas. ', "On the other hand, studies predict that if we don't act on climate change by 2050, the global economy could shrink by 18% because of the damage caused by natural disasters and extreme temperatures to buildings, lives, businesses and food supplies. ", "Such damage would hit the world's poorest the hardest.", 'Misleading posts claiming renewable energy failures led to blackouts went viral earlier in the year, when a massive electricity grid failure left millions of Texans in the dark and cold.
