['<b class="ssrcss-hmf8ql-BoldText e5tfeyi3">The UK government faces a gap between how much it raises in taxes and what it plans to spend. To bridge this gap it needs to borrow money.</b>', 'So who does it borrow from? And when does that money have to be repaid?', 'The government gets most of its income from taxes - for example, workers pay income tax, everyone pays VAT on certain goods, and companies pay tax on their profits.', 'It could, in theory, cover all of its spending from taxes like these - and in some years that happens.', 'But governments have not always been willing to increase taxes enough to cover their spending plans. ', "That's partly because raising taxes or cutting spending is generally unpopular. ", 'But higher taxes also mean people have less money to spend, so businesses make less profit, which can be bad for jobs and wages. Lower profits also mean they pay less tax too.', 'So governments sometimes choose to borrow to boost the economy when it looks like it might be at risk of slowing down. ', 'Governments also borrow to fund major long-term projects such as new railways and roads, which it also hopes will help the economy to grow.', 'The government borrows money by selling financial products called bonds.', 'A bond is a promise to pay money in the future. Most require the borrower to make regular interest payments in the meantime.', 'UK government bonds - known as "gilts" - are normally seen as very safe, with little risk the money won\'t be repaid.', 'Gilts are mainly bought by financial institutions in the UK and abroad, such as pension funds, investment funds, banks and insurance companies. ', 'The Bank of England also <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-15198789" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">bought trillions of pounds\' worth of government bonds to support the economy</a>, though recently it has started selling them again. ', 'Yes - though opinions differ about how much.', "The total amount the government owes is called the national debt. It's currently £2.45tn. That's two-and-a-half trillion or thousand billion. ", 'That\'s nearly as much as <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-13200758" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">the value of all the goods and services produced in the UK in a year</a>, known as GDP. ', 'Some economists fear the government is borrowing too much, at too great a cost.  ', 'Others argue extra borrowing helps the economy grow faster - generating more tax revenue in the long run.', 'However, the larger the national debt gets, the more interest the government has to pay on the money it has borrowed. ', 'The government is  <a href="https://ifs.org.uk/publications/outlook-public-finances-under-bank-englands-august-2022-forecast" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">expected to spend over £100bn</a> in 2022 and 2023 on debt interest - more than it spends on education. ', 'This video can not be played', 'What does a billion pounds look like... and what can it buy?', 'Any money borrowed now will have to be paid back one day. ', 'That will mean that in the future there will be higher taxes and/or less money available to pay for public services. ', 'Governments often increase borrowing when they face unusually difficult situations, such as the coronavirus pandemic, or the current cost-of-living crisis. ', 'This can fund extra services needed to support people during the crisis, such as <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-58090533" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">help with higher energy bills</a> or paying some of the wages of people who couldn\'t work during Covid. ', "But most economists and politicians agree that debt can't keep growing for ever, because at some point it will become impossible to keep paying the interest.", 'The Chancellor Jeremy Hunt has said that he plans to get debt falling relative to the size of the economy "over the medium term". ', 'He will set out how he plans to do that in <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-63555313" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">the government\'s Autumn Statement on 17 November</a>. He has said he will raise some taxes, and may also <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-63268238" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">have to cut spending substantially</a>.', "The deficit is the amount by which the government's income falls short of what it spends.", 'Borrowing covers most of this gap, or sometimes it sells assets such as property. ', "In years when a government spends less than its income, it has what's known as a surplus. ", 'Debt is the total amount of money owed by the government that has built up over years. ', 'It rises when there is a deficit, and falls in those years when there is a surplus.  ', '© 2022 BBC.
