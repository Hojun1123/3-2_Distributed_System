Previous chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-63005302" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">unveiled big tax cuts</a>, with the promise of more to follow.', 'Not only has Jeremy Hunt scrapped all that, but he is looking for ways to raise another £20bn from taxes.', 'One way to do that is to freeze the thresholds between income tax bands - and to freeze them for a longer period of time.', 'That means as wages go up more people will find themselves in higher tax bands.', 'It is unlikely to be popular with Conservatives who hope to convince voters they are a low-tax party at the next general election.', "Tax rises won't be enough to close a gap in the UK government's finances, so Mr Hunt is expected to also rein in spending.", "Financial markets were spooked by Kwasi Kwarteng's uncosted plans, so Mr Hunt wants to show them he will balance the books.", "Departments in Whitehall will be told to live within their means. Because of the way it is funded, that means the Welsh government, which holds the purse strings for most of Wales' public sector, is unlikely to get much extra cash.", "And cash is what we need, say Mark Drakeford and his ministers. Wales' funding increased significantly last year. But soaring inflation has wiped out a lot of the value of the budget ", "That's why Labour and Plaid Cymru warn about another era of austerity, similar to the Cameron-Osborne era in the 2010s when spending was slashed after the financial crisis.", 'Commentators think this could be the most difficult conundrum facing Mr Hunt.', 'If public services do not get extra funding, how are they going to pay staff the wages they need to cope with rising costs?', "Put simply, they can't.
