', 'Mr Smith, the chief executive and co-founder of StoryFile, told the BBC the technology meant, once a person had died, it was possible to have a conversation with them "as if they are there, and they will answer you".', 'He said it meant his mother had brought "the aspects of her life that were most important to her to the people who loved her most. And it was very meaningful to them".', "His mother's words were her own, and not the creation of artificial intelligence (AI), Mr Smith stressed.", 'To make a conversational video, a person must make a recording while still alive, answering numerous questions about their life.', "Later, after that person's death, an AI system selects appropriate clips to play in response to questions from people viewing a remembrance video; the person in the video appears to listen and reply.", "Rollo Carpenter, who created the chatbot CleverBot - and has no connection to Mr Smith's company StoryFile - said the system was not trying to construct its own replies and was not using AI to invent answers.", '"It\'s just selecting from a pre-recorded set of sequences and cleverly allowing people to cause them to be played," he said.', 'Mrs Smith co-founded the National Holocaust Centre in Nottinghamshire, from where she ran a successful Holocaust education programme. She was awarded an MBE in 2005 for her work.', 'The founders of StoryFile hit upon the idea for the company while working on <a href="https://sfi.usc.edu/dit" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">creating interactive holograms of Holocaust survivors for the USC Shoah Foundation.</a>', 'The firm sees a wide range of possible commercial applications for the technology, from customer service to sales.', 'It has also encouraged some famous contemporary celebrities to document their careers using the tech, including the Star Trek actor William Shatner, whose video can be interacted with <a href="https://storyfile.com/gallery/william-shatner/" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">on the company website.</a>', 'Looking ahead, Mr Smith envisages a world in which people document their lives on a continuous basis, suggesting that users could "speak to your 18-year-old self, when you\'re 50, or introduce your children to your 16-year-old self".', 'Previously, it has been suggested that AI could be used to create fully synthetic versions of dead people.', 'But Mr Smith rejects the idea that current technology is capable of this: "Everything about us is so absolutely unique to us," he said. "There is no way you can create a synthetic version of me, even though it may look like me."', 'Mr Carpenter agrees, saying that using current AI technology to create a "computer-generated" person  would risk "putting words into the deceased person\'s mouth - and it could be worse than that, those words could be believed by the audience".', 'The limits of AI conversationalists were demonstrated by Meta\'s BlenderBot 3, which was criticised for making offensive remarks and said <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-62497674" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">unflattering things about the company\'s co-founder Mark Zuckerberg.</a>', 'Meta said that it was a prototype created for research purposes, adding it had warned users they should expect it to say things it ideally should not.', 'World Cup winner Jürgen Klinsmann invites you to subscribe to his daily World Cup newsletter.', '© 2022 BBC.
