", 'The figure was higher than the national average of 14%. The report said customers in Scotland, the South West and the South East were most likely to honour their reservations, with just 10% failing to show up.', "UK Hospitality said the £17.6bn loss from no-shows equated to 13.3% of the sector's £132bn in pre-pandemic revenue.", '<i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">Source: Zonal and CGA\'s Technology survey</i>', 'Vicky Liner, marketing director at West Midlands-based Suburban Inns, said no-shows had "calmed down a little bit" after the venue started asking patrons to hand over card details and put down deposits when making a booking. ', '"Taking deposits wasn\'t something we really wanted to do, but we\'ve had to - and they\'re no bad thing if they help to change the culture," she said.', '"We still want spontaneity in hospitality and give people the option to just walk in."', 'In response to the survey findings, Zonal and UK Hospitality have launched a campaign aimed at encouraging people to honour the bookings they make, or at least inform venues if they have to cancel a booking. ', 'UK Hospitality\'s chief executive Kate Nicholls said no-shows had been a blight on the industry for "many, many years". Added to the difficulties businesses were experiencing due to the pandemic, they were "currently deeply damaging."', '"Our pubs, bars and restaurants deserve our support and it\'s encouraging that this research shows there is a growing realisation among customers of the need to honour their booking or let the venue know they can\'t make it," she said.', '"But it also highlights the fact that no shows still happen far too often, with younger customers particularly responsible, and that really can\'t go on."', '© 2022 BBC.
