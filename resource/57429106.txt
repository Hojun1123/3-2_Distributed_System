['<b class="ssrcss-hmf8ql-BoldText e5tfeyi3">Prime Minister Boris Johnson flew to Cornwall ahead of the G7 summit - but some have questioned whether it was the most environmentally friendly way of travelling there. </b>', "We've looked at the different ways he could have made this journey and estimated the contribution each would have made to carbon emissions.", 'Mr Johnson flew in a chartered Airbus A321 from London Stansted to Newquay, on Wednesday afternoon - a 49-minute journey, according to the tracking site Flightradar24. ', "We asked his office how many passengers were on board but haven't received a reply. ", 'But we can make a start on an emissions calculation by first considering the carbon dioxide (CO2) contribution per passenger on an average domestic commercial flight.

', "If we assume Mr Johnson's flight had fewer passengers than an average commercial flight, his individual contribution by flying to Cornwall would have been considerably more than this.", "It's also a 55-minute drive from the airport to Carbis Bay, where the summit is being held.", 'And if the prime minister travelled alone (plus his driver) in a luxury car - a Jaguar, for example - using petrol, this would add a further 20kg of CO2.  ', 'This accounts for the whole vehicle, unlike the figures for air and rail travel, which produce a per-passenger amount.', 'A diesel car would contribute considerably less carbon (but higher levels of another pollutant, nitrogen dioxide).', 'The same journey by <b class="ssrcss-hmf8ql-BoldText e5tfeyi3">train</b> - from London Paddington to nearby St Erth station - releases 14kg of CO2 per passenger, according to the government\'s carbon-conversion database.

", 'Emissions are substantially less from an electric vehicle. ', 'Even for a keen cyclist, the 28-hour <b class="ssrcss-hmf8ql-BoldText e5tfeyi3">bike</b> ride might have been a step too far.', "The manufacturing of all these vehicles has a carbon footprint too but we haven't included that here.
