"It\'s just overloaded with the amount of people that are calling."', 'Since lockdown ended, crews have been seeing a "much bigger influx" of calls, putting pressure on the entire NHS, he said.', 'Last month, nursing director Mark Docherty said WMAS <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-61583251" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">was dealing with a "catastrophic situation"</a> including long hospital handovers and delayed response times.', 'Mr Docherty warned the service could face collapse unless ambulance delays outside hospitals were reduced.', "Mr O'Byrne said the decision-making and challenge of the role were the things he loved most.", '"When you first start out it is a little bit of a shock, because it\'s very different dealing with an actual patient in front of you rather than a training scenario," he said. ', '"But you do quickly get used to the things that you are going and dealing with."', 'Mr O\'Byrne said people often thought being a paramedic was "all blue lights and sirens and fast pace and action".
