But she's never fulfilled the promise of a Demi Lovato metal album... until now. ", "The singer's eighth album, Holy Fvck, is a sonic assault of razor blade guitars and throat-scorching vocals that strips away the radio-friendly veneer of her earlier material.", 'She signalled the stylistic shift earlier this year, with an Instagram post captioned: "A funeral for my pop music." In the accompanying photo, Lovato raised both middle fingers to the camera, while surrounded by her record label team.', '"It wasn\'t an actual funeral," laughs the star, "but I was in a label meeting and we all happened be wearing black and I was like, \'This is perfect because I\'m not playing pop music anymore. This is a rock album.\'', '"I definitely wanted to go harder with the sound."

"Even in your 20s you think, \'Oh, I know who I am, I figured it out.\' But [this song] was [about] a realisation that I had when I turned 29."', '"I just wrote it from a very vulnerable place. It was something that I needed to get off of my chest."', 'Lovato was careful not to name Valderrama directly in our interview and a representative for the actor declined to comment.', 'In the meantime, 29 has gone viral on TikTok, with dozens of fans using the audio to soundtrack their own accounts of dating older men.', '"This song has me sobbing," <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@takeyoutocourt/video/7132130529255623978" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">wrote one user</a>, who was also in a relationship with a 12-year age gap.

"When people hear a song called Heaven from Demi Lovato they\'re going to think, \'Oh, she almost died. It\'s a song about going to heaven\', and actually, it\'s a song about masturbation.
