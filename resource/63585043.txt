', 'As well as fuelling deadly floods and drought, rising temperatures are cited as a cause of spontaneous explosions of Siberian permafrost, mustard shortages and the planet becoming dimmer. ', 'Many of the impacts of climate change are devastating. Some are weird. ', 'Giant craters in thawing Siberian permafrost have been attributed by some Russian scientists to warmer ground temperatures causing underground pockets of gas to spontaneously explode. Permafrost is defined as land that has been frozen continuously for more than two years.', 'It\'s only <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3263/11/2/71" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">one hypothesis</a> to explain the formation of giant craters in the Arctic landscape.

', 'And as well as blasting holes in Earth\'s wilderness, climate change could also be dimming the planet\'s "shine", according to scientists at Big Bear Solar Observatory in New Jersey. ', 'By measuring the sunlight reflected from Earth to the dark part of the moon at night, scientists measured what they call "earthshine" or albedo - basically Earth\'s reflectiveness. ', 'The <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2021GL094888" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">studies suggested</a> that the amount of low cloud cover over the eastern Pacific Ocean is reducing due to warming ocean temperatures. ', 'Since these clouds act like a mirror, reflecting light from the Sun back into space, without them that reflected light diminishes. So, according to these scientists, we might actually be taking the shine off our little blue dot. ', "While we might be causing global warming, we're not the only species experiencing it. Some creatures are affected in truly surprising ways. ", 'In some reptiles, the sex of offspring is partly determined by the temperature at which the eggs are incubated. Genetically male central bearded dragons - a species of lizard found in Australia - will actually <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn27814-zoologger-the-lizard-that-changes-its-sex-to-suit-the-weather/" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">change from male to female</a> when they are incubated over a certain temperature.

', 'Extreme weather is also making it harder to grow food. Staples like wheat, corn and coffee are already being affected. And this year, there have been some notable condiment shortages. ', 'In April, Huy Fong Foods, a California-based company that produces around 20 million bottles of Sriracha chilli sauce every year, sent a <a href="https://www.callifd.com/uploads/1/3/0/7/130789654/chili_pepper_shortage_2022.pdf" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">letter to customers</a> warning of a "severe shortage" of chillies.
