She reassured me I wasn\'t going to die next week," she said.', '"She was a translator when I felt overwhelmed, and my voice when I wanted to say something but felt like I couldn\'t because I was just the silly patient. I wouldn\'t be here today if it wasn\'t for her."', 'Ms Haines was treated in Swansea where a clinical nurse solely dedicated to secondary breast cancer is in post. ', 'Secondary cancer means that the cancer has spread to another part of the body and can no longer be cured.', 'Her treatment has now moved to Cardiff, where the latest data shows the role does not exist.
