', '"In particular, this inquiry can look at how distinct decisions were made by each of the four nations for their respective countries either on a four nations basis or separately. ', '"We have been consistent in our determination that our actions and those of our public sector partners in Wales are fully and properly scrutinised as part of this inquiry.
