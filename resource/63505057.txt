He remains on trial, with the next hearing on Monday.', 'After exit polls projected that he would secure a majority, Mr Netanyahu told Likud supporters that he would set up a government that would "look after all the citizens of Israel, without exception, because the state is all of ours". ', '"We\'ll restore security, we\'ll cut the cost of living, we\'ll widen the circle of peace even further, we\'ll restore Israel as a rising power among the nations."', "Israeli media said the final results gave Likud 32 seats; Mr Lapid's centrist Yesh Atid party 24; the far-right ultra-nationalist Religious Zionism alliance 14; and the centre-right National Unity party of Defence Minister Benny Gantz 12.

', 'Mr Ben-Gvir was a follower of the late, explicitly racist, ultra-nationalist Meir Kahane, whose organisation was banned in Israel and designated as a terrorist group by the United States. He has been convicted of incitement to racism and supporting a terrorist organisation.', "The inclusion of Religious Zionism in the new government would alarm many left-wing and centrist Israelis, as well as Israeli Arabs, who make up a fifth of the population. It could also strain ties with the Palestinians and Israel's Western and Arab allies.", 'The US said on Wednesday it hoped "all Israeli government officials will continue to share the values of an open, democratic society, including tolerance and respect for all in civil society, particularly for minority groups". ', 'Mr Smotrich has said he wants to be defence minister, while Mr Ben-Gvir has demanded to be public security minister. ', '"The time has come to impose order here. The time has come for there to be a landlord," Mr Ben-Gvir tweeted on Thursday, after the Israeli police said an officer was stabbed and wounded by a Palestinian man in occupied East Jerusalem. The Palestinian was shot dead by officers at the scene.', 'Three other Palestinians, including an Islamic Jihad militant, were also killed during raids by Israeli security forces in the occupied West Bank on Thursday, Palestinian health officials said.
