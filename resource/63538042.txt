', 'Officials locked down the district that is home to the factory, run by Foxconn, on 2 November for seven days.', 'It comes as China continues to target "zero Covid", using lockdowns to tackle even minor outbreaks. ', '"As we have done throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, we are prioritising the health and safety of the workers in our supply chain," said a statement from Apple, which launched its new iPhone line in September. ', '"We continue to see strong demand for iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max models. However, we now expect lower iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max shipments than we previously anticipated and customers will experience longer wait times to receive their new products."', 'The announcement will likely disappoint investors who were hoping China would lift its Covid restrictions in the near future. Chinese stock markets rose sharply on Friday on the back of rumours of an end to lockdowns.

On Monday, the company started a recruitment drive at its Zhengzhou plant.
