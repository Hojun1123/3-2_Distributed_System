', 'Macmillan Cancer said the jump revealed a system that was "failing" patients.   ', 'Sarah Christie, Macmillan policy and public affairs manager, told BBC News NI that the figures revealed a "dark insight into a healthcare system that is failing time and again to meet the needs of people living with cancer".', 'According to targets set by the Department of Health (DoH), at least 98% of patients diagnosed with cancer should receive their first definitive treatment within 31 days of a decision to treat.', 'It also says 95% of patients should begin treatment within 62 days after an urgent GP referral.', 'However, <a href="https://www.health-ni.gov.uk/news/publication-ni-cancer-waiting-times-statistics-release-april-june-2022" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">the latest figures published on Thursday morning</a> showed that both those targets have been missed over the past year. None of the department\'s cancer waiting time targets have been met, the figures show.', 'During June 2022, 87.9% of patients received their first treatment within the 31-day deadline, compared to 93.4% in June 2021.', 'In respect of the 62-day target following an urgent GP referral, only 38.9% of patients began their treatment on time during June 2022, down significantly from 54.2% in June 2021.', 'Ms Christie said: "People have a right to be frustrated.

", '"My mind went into overdrive and I started to plan my funeral. I thought I could feel the tumour growing.', '"I was anxious - it was the longest week just waiting." ', "Rosemary's surgery was delayed during Covid when many surgeries were postponed.
