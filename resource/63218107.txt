', 'It means activities such as protesting, handing out leaflets and holding vigils will be prohibited within the area.', 'The decision has been taken by BCP Council following a public consultation. ', 'Anyone failing to comply could incur a fixed penalty notice of £100 or face court action, the council said.

', 'But anti-abortion campaigners said their gatherings aimed to offer help.', 'Councillor Bobbie Dove, member for community safety, said the authority worked hard to understand "the difficulties and experiences" of people either visiting or working at the clinic.', 'But a consultation was launched after attempts to find "a negotiated position which could be agreed upon by all the parties involved" failed.

', 'Ms Dove said the strength of support was "clear" and the subsequent decision taken was "balanced and proportionate".', '"Whilst we acknowledge the right of anyone to conduct a peaceful protest, we had to balance this against the distress caused or likely to be caused, and the detrimental impact of behaviours experienced by those accessing medical services or doing their jobs," she added. ', "Activities prohibited also include intimidating clinic visitors or its staff and photographing or recording the clinic's users.", 'The buffer zone will be in operation Monday to Friday between 07:00 and 19:00 BST.
