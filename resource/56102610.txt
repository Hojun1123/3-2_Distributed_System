These have not been factored in yet in the assessments from Sage, which have been publicly released.', 'We have looked at what they say about the risks in a number of areas.', '<b class="ssrcss-hmf8ql-BoldText e5tfeyi3">Sage has said (with "moderate confidence") that schools have a "moderate" impact on transmission.</b>', 'The phased opening of schools has already started in Wales and Scotland.
