['<b class="ssrcss-hmf8ql-BoldText e5tfeyi3">Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has called for "a full and transparent investigation into Randox and the government contracts".</b>', 'It follows the resignation of Conservative MP Owen Paterson, who had been employed as a consultant by Randox since 2015.', 'The Committee on Standards watchdog had criticised his behaviour, saying: "No previous case of paid advocacy has seen so many breaches or such a clear pattern of behaviour in failing to separate private and public interests."', 'Randox is a big international testing and health company based in Northern Ireland. It was set up in 1982.', 'It is well-known as the sponsor of the Grand National, and it has made several contributions to the Conservative Party.', 'It had multi-million pound contracts with the UK government years before the pandemic started, and has been a big player in the Covid testing programme.', 'The <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-55008133" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">company was at a meeting</a> with the government on 17 March 2020, where they discussed how to implement the new testing regime. ', 'The government decided that the testing programme would be built around big centralised labs set up outside existing healthcare or research structures, as opposed to building on the existing labs in universities.', 'Owen Paterson, who was Conservative MP for North Shropshire, declared that from August 2015 he had been a consultant to Randox. From April 2017 they were paying him £8,333 a month for 16 hours of work, making him one of the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-59206904" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">highest paid consultants in the House of Commons</a>.', 'He pointed out in his declaration that he had "consulted the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments about this role".', 'That is true, and <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/452758/OP_for_publication_amended.pdf" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">what the committee told him</a> was: "Although Randox will have engagement with government in pursuit of its business, you have informed us that it will not be part of your role with the company to be involved in such engagement."', 'But the Standards Committee found that he had in fact approached and met officials at the Food Standards Agency, and ministers at the Department for International Development a number of times, on behalf of his employers.', 'He also used his parliamentary office and stationery for his consultancy work, and failed to declare his interests in some meetings, <a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/290/committee-on-standards/news/158246/committee-on-standards-publish-report-on-the-conduct-of-rt-hon-owen-paterson-mp/" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">its report said</a>.', 'Mr Paterson claimed that his approaches had been attempts to prevent a "serious wrong" - which is allowed - but the committee rejected this in all but one case.
