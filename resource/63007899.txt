We will consider those changes and make the right judgements for people in Scotland.', '"We want to make sure that we do the right thing by people, by our public services and by our economy and will set out our stance in light of the decisions made by the Chancellor when it comes to establishing our budgets for the forthcoming year."', 'Mr Swinney, who is acting as finance secretary while Kate Forbes is on maternity leave, will also need to decide how to respond to the Chancellor announcing that people buying properties worth up to £250,000 will no longer need to pay stamp duty. ', 'House buyers in Scotland currently have to pay the Scottish equivalent of stamp duty - Land and Buildings Transactions Tax - on properties worth over £140,000.', 'However, Scottish businesses will benefit from the scrapping of a planned rise in corporation tax from 19% to 25%.', 'And a 1.25% rise in National Insurance will also be reversed across the UK from 6 November - which the UK government said would save 2.3 million Scottish workers an average of £285 a year. ', 'The UK government will also look to work with the Scottish government and local authorities to set up Investment Zones in Scotland, which will offer tax cuts for businesses and more relaxed planning rules to release more land for housing and commercial development.', 'Meanwhile, Scotch whisky distillers and brewers will benefit from an end to planned reforms of alcohol duty, and retailers will hope to be boosted by a new system of VAT-free shopping for foreign tourists.

', "The SNP are frequently taunted in the House of Commons that Scotland's the highest taxed part of the UK - but Mr Swinney said most people in Scotland pay less in taxation than they would if they did in England.", 'One note that chimes with the Chancellor, the government in Edinburgh will engage with the UK Government on investment zones.', 'Overall, the two governments are going in different directions with the Deputy First Minister leading to the point that independence is the natural conclusion.', 'Questioned about prosperity and stability under independence, John Swinney said the UK is not a good example of fiscal stability.
