The company has prioritised delivering multi-million pound dividends rather than paying its workers a decent wage," Ms Graham added.', 'Around half of containers brought in to the UK are transported via the port.', 'Unite said in a statement that the strike action will have a "huge effect on the UK\'s supply chain and will also cause severe disruption to international maritime trade, as well as the UK\'s supply chain including the logistics and haulage sectors".', 'A spokesperson at Felixstowe port said: "The port has not had a strike since 1989 and we are disappointed that the union has served notice of industrial action while talks are ongoing.
