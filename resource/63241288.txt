', 'At Grovelands Care Home in Yeovil staff said they have had to wait in the past for up to 10 hours for an ambulance to arrive to help with a resident who had fallen over.', 'Tere Lattanzio, 81, lives in the home. She took part in a demonstration of the new lifting chairs and thinks having them is reassuring.', 'Ms Lattanzio said: "I have fallen numerous times because I have Parkinson\'s. I don\'t feel my feet so it\'s very difficult for me to stand up and do anything." ', 'Karen Cheshire is the Business Manager at Grovelands Care Home. ', 'Ms Cheshire said:  "We think our residents are going to benefit hugely from the use of this. ', '"Anyone who falls on the floor will feel demoralised and want to get up from the floor as quickly as possible, and using this particular equipment is a more dignified way of lifting our residents from the floor safely."', '<i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">Follow BBC West on </i><a href="https://www.facebook.com/pointswest" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Facebook</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">, </i><a href="https://twitter.com/bbcbristol" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Twitter</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2"> and </i><a href="https://www.instagram.com/bbcwest" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Instagram</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">.
