', 'Conrad Energy, the developers, said the <a href="https://conradenergy.co.uk/projects/solar/larport-solar-farm/" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">total area of the application site</a> for the Larport Farm solar project was about 120 acres and the scheme would generate "enough to power the equivalent of up to 10,400 homes".', 'It held a drop-in session for the community and hosted an online consultation event and stated it "would like to thank everyone who helped shape our plans through their feedback".', 'It stated solar panels would be installed on about "40% of the total site area, but less than 5% of the land is actually disturbed".', 'Conrad Energy said the project was "fully reversible and after 40 years the rested land will benefit from increased biodiversity and an improved ecosystem". ', 'The soil would be "enhanced as it will be far less intensively farmed during this time" and the company said as part of the planning process it was "required to demonstrate that there will be biodiversity gain on site".', 'Conrad Energy expected the planning decision to be announced early this year.', '<i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">Follow BBC West Midlands on </i><a href="https://www.facebook.com/MidlandsBBC/" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Facebook</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">, </i><a href="https://twitter.com/bbcmtd" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Twitter</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2"> and </i><a href="https://www.instagram.com/bbc_midlands/?hl=en" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Instagram</a><i class="ssrcss-xbdn93-ItalicText e5tfeyi2">.
