', '<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-62136022" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">When the cap was first announced in July</a> it was initially in place until 11 September.

', 'The airport also said the cap would be kept under regular review and could be lifted early if staffing levels improved. ', 'Heathrow chief commercial officer Ross Baker said: "Our primary concern is ensuring we give our passengers a reliable service when they travel."', '"We want to remove the cap as soon as possible, but we can only do so when we are confident that everyone operating at the airport has the resources to deliver the service our passengers deserve," he added. ', 'In response, a spokesman for airline Virgin Atlantic said: "We are disappointed that Heathrow Airport has already decided to extend the passenger capacity cap until the end of October, as additional resources come on line every week and the airport experience improves."', 'The airline said that its ground handlers, Cobalt Ground Solutions, which are responsible for services including ramp and baggage operations, currently have staff resourcing at 95% of 2019 levels.', '"Airline customers have a right to expect their bookings will be honoured and we\'re doing everything in our power to minimise disruption, getting our customers to where they need to be smoothly," he added.

But since then it has struggled to recruit and train new staff quickly enough.
