['<b class="ssrcss-hmf8ql-BoldText e5tfeyi3">Doctors have warned of "unsafe" maternity services at a Sussex hospital in emails seen by the BBC.</b>', 'In the email chain between senior staff at the Royal Sussex County Hospital in Brighton, consultants wrote of "compromises" to patient care.  ', 'One doctor said during a birth "we were one step away from a potential disaster".', 'The University Hospitals Sussex NHS Foundation Trust said almost 98% of patients were happy with its care.', 'One senior doctor wrote in the exchange that "increasing workforce issues" had contributed to making the situation in the maternity unit "almost unmanageable at times". ', 'They added: "We are making compromises to patient care every day as a result."', 'Another wrote that their workload was often "unmanageable, and obviously impacted by the staffing issues".', 'A senior member of maternity staff said "we are delivering suboptimal care" and "we are one step away from potential disaster". ', 'A doctor also said staff were being "stretched", and that there were delays to women\'s care.', 'Another consultant wrote: "We have an unsafe service and we have to strive for better than that."', 'Maternity services across the country have been put under the spotlight after a review led by Dr Bill Kirkup reported last month that <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-kent-62899900" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">45 babies at the East Kent NHS Hospitals Trust might have survived</a> if they had received better care.

", 'These consultants are expected to be visible and effective leaders across their departments with risk management one of their key roles. ', "In the email chain I have seen they not only highlight serious safety issues but also the fact that those concerns are not being listened to by the trust's senior managers. ", 'Last month Dr Bill Kirkup wrote a scathing report into the maternity department in East Kent. ', 'He highlighted the fact that for more than a decade that trust "deflected and denied" what was happening. ', 'It now falls to the executive board of University Hospitals Sussex NHS Trust to act upon these concerns or - as one of the email contributors says - "we will have grave outcomes".  ', 'In October 2021 consultants at the Royal Sussex County Hospital wrote to their chief executive, warning about serious clinical safety concerns and burnout among staff, and said some surgery should be diverted elsewhere.
