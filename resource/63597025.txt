', "It meanders, slows down and speeds up like a river and it's this movement that creates our weather.  ", 'It is also the dividing line between cold polar air and warmer tropical air.  So as it changes shape and position, the UK can either be on the colder side or warmer side of the jet.', '"This weather pattern, while fairly unusual for the time of year, is not linked to climate change," says King.', 'While the warm air being dumped over the UK is "not a regular occurrence", it is a weather phenomenon that we experience every so often in the UK - so it is not a one-off.', 'The warmest recorded daytime temperature in November in the UK was in 2015, when temperatures reached 22.4C - an event that was also linked to the jet stream.', 'King adds: "Climate change may be altering the typical position of the jet stream further north - when considering its horizontal position/latitude averages over decades. This is different, though, from this scenario where the jet stream is meandering north to south like a big U.', '"However, the warmer weather we\'ve experienced this autumn - and extreme overnight temperatures just seen - are the types of conditions we\'re likely to experience more frequently in the future with climate change," he cautions.
