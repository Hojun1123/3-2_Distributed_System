It is a by-product of fertiliser manufacturing.', 'Last week, CF Industries, the UK\'s biggest CO2 producer, stopped production at its Teesside and Cheshire fertiliser plants "due to high natural gas prices". Wholesale gas prices have jumped by 250% since January, according to Oil &amp; Gas UK, the industry group. ', 'CF Industries said it did not "have an estimate for when production will resume". ', 'The BBC has also been told that officials from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy have been "working with" the company in recent days.', 'Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng <a href="https://twitter.com/KwasiKwarteng/status/1439614634064064512" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">tweeted</a> that he had met Mr Will and "discussed the pressures the business is facing and explored possible ways forward to secure vital supplies, including to our food and energy industries".', 'Food producers and supermarkets have warned of the impact CO2 shortages are having on the industry.', 'Ranjit Singh Boparan, owner of UK poultry giant 2 Sisters Food Group, said the decision by CT Industries to halt operations, was a "massive body blow" for the food sector and placed it "at breaking point".', 'Adam Couch, the boss of pork producer Cranswick said the industry was "already at tipping point ahead of the demanding Christmas period".', '"We have worked tirelessly throughout the pandemic to keep food on the shelves, but there is a real risk of product shortages across the country if the government does not act immediately to address these issues," he added.', 'Supermarket Ocado said it had "limited stock" of some frozen items due to gas shortages, while another supermarket told the BBC the situation was "escalating quickly".', 'One supermarket executive told the BBC the CO2 issue is "escalating quickly" and was causing a "big supply issue".', '"The big meat suppliers are saying they have two to three days\' supply and are now having to prioritise how they use what they have," he said.', 'He said the problem "compounds" supply issues the food, drink and supermarket industries are already facing due to shortages of HGV drivers in the UK, caused partly by the pandemic and Brexit.', 'The British Poultry Council said that the supply chains will "inevitably slow down" if CO2 supplies become tighter and more unpredictable in the next five to seven days.
