Most of have written letters of no confidence in him, although the total number formally calling for a contest may be higher.', 'Mr Johnson has dismissed calls for him to quit, adding it would not be "responsible right now given everything that\'s going on".', "Under Tory party rules, 54 letters are required to set up a vote on the PM's position, a move which could eventually lead to a contest to replace him.", 'Only Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the backbench committee that organises leadership contests, knows exactly how many have been submitted.', '<a href="https://twitter.com/BBCWorldatOne" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">Speaking on BBC Radio 4\'s The World at One</a>, Ms Dorries said the debate over Partygate had become a "Westminster bubble issue" and the public was "ready to move on".', '"There is obviously, I think probably led by one or two individuals, a campaign behind the scenes to try, attempt to remove the prime minister for individual reasons to do with personal ambition or other reasons," she said.', 'She added: "The people who most want to get rid of Boris Johnson are Keir Starmer and the SNP".', '"I would just ask my colleagues to reflect on that, and do we really want to do the opposition\'s work - and do we really believe the public will vote for a party that they think is divided?"', 'Home Secretary Priti Patel has also backed the prime minister, telling Conservative MPs who want to remove him to "forget it", BBC political correspondent Helen Catt reports.', 'Ms Patel told the Daily Mail that writing letters of no confidence was a "sideshow" and warned that the public "wouldn\'t thank the Conservative Party for talking about itself at a time when people had anxieties, concerns [and] apprehensions".', 'She also warned colleagues against overshadowing the Platinum Jubilee celebrations, saying "all the focus" this weekend should be on the Queen and her "long-standing dedicated service".

", 'Some of the calls have come in quick succession, others months apart. ', "They've come from MPs elected in different years, with different ideologies. Some of them backed Boris Johnson at the last Tory leadership contest, others backed his rivals. ", 'Some Tory MPs are convinced there is a degree of co-ordination behind closed doors.', 'One senior Tory told me he believes supporters of Jeremy Hunt are among those being particularly critical publicly. ', 'Others attribute the steady drip-drip of letters in recent days to a ripple effect. As soon as a few critical MPs came out publicly, they argue, others felt emboldened to do the same. ', 'Co-ordination or not, there is no doubt MPs do talk to each other - there are Whatsapp groups and sub-Whatsapp groups of Tory MPs.', 'Even before Sue Gray\'s report came out, I was told the tea rooms of Westminster were alive with chatter about who was "ready to move".', 'Some of that chatter has been more muted as MPs are out of office for recess - with some arguing the Jubilee weekend is not the time for "internal warfare".
