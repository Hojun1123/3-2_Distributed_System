', 'And Scott Benton, Tory MP for Blackpool South, said: "My constituents are understandably anxious about fracking returning to the Fylde coast."', 'Labour\'s shadow climate change secretary Ed Miliband, who secured an urgent question in Parliament on the issue, described fracking as a "dangerous fantasy" and accused Mr Rees-Mogg of "creating a charter for earthquakes".', '"We now have an energy policy run for big fossil fuel interests not for the British people. No to the windfall tax and yes to dangerous, unsafe fracking," he said.', 'Mr Rees-Mogg said fracking was in the national interest and would make the country richer - and he accused Mr Miliband and others who spoke out against it of being "luddites".', 'He suggested current limits on acceptable levels of seismic activity are too restrictive and said the government is determined to "realise any potential sources of domestic gas".', 'Regulations require work to stop if tremors above 0.5 on the Richter scale are detected, but Mr Rees-Mogg said he wanted that lifted potentially to 2.5.', '"There are millions of seismic events of 2.5 or lower in the world every year, we should not assume that every seismic event is the San Francisco earthquake."', 'But Conservative former minister Sir Greg Knight told MPs the risks of shale gas exploration were an "unknown quantity" and "the occurrence of seismic events as a result of fracking remains a challenge to the experts".', 'He added: "The safety of the public is not a currency in which some of us choose to speculate."', 'Mr Jacob Rees-Mogg said there was no evidence fracking was "worse" than coal mining or oil extraction, which were not subject to the same limitations.', 'While <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-50267454" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">fracking was halted in 2019</a>, amid opposition from environmentalists and local concerns, Prime Minister Liz Truss has backed fracking as a way to help boost the UK\'s domestic gas supplies during a time of skyrocketing energy prices.', 'She pledged that local support would be needed for sites to go ahead - and the Conservative manifesto for the 2019 general election said fracking would only be reconsidered if "the science shows categorically that it can be done safely".', 'Fracking in the UK has been a controversial subject within local communities and amongst MPs due to its association with minor earthquakes.', 'In 2019, at oil and gas exploration company Cuadrilla\'s fracking site in Lancashire, <a href="http://www.earthquakes.bgs.ac.uk/research/PrestonNewRoadFAQ.html" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">more than 120 tremors were recorded</a> - although most were too small to be felt.', 'Alongside the announcement on Thursday the <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1105675/BEISInducedSeismicityReportOR220501A.pdf" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">government published a new review</a>, commissioned in April, from the British Geological Survey (BGS) which considers any changes to the science around the practice.', 'On the risk of larger tremors from fracking, the report concludes: "Forecasting the occurrence of large earthquakes… remains a scientific challenge for the geoscience community."', 'Within shale rock there can be small faults and areas of stress. During drilling, water is injected into the rock to extract the gas. The water lubricates the shale rock, moving parts of the rock along these faults, and this movement can trigger a tremor.', '© 2022 BBC.
