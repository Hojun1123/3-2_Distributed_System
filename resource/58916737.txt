['<b class="ssrcss-hmf8ql-BoldText e5tfeyi3">Health Secretary Sajid Javid was asked on BBC Breakfast if the number of GPs had fallen in the past two years and he said: "No, there\'s 1,200 more on a full-time equivalent basis."</b>', 'Later in the day, Labour leader Keir Starmer told BBC News: "We\'ve now got less [GPs] than we had in 2019."', 'They are each referring to different figures for the number of GPs.', 'The full-time equivalent basis that the health secretary was talking about means that instead of counting the number of GPs, you count the number of hours they are contracted to work - so two GPs contracted to work 19 hours a week each would count as just over one full-time equivalent GP.
