We were not at the table in terms of preparation for a pandemic.', '"Therefore it is hardly surprising that there was insufficient guidance sensitive to the context of care homes, but guidance written for a hospital which is simply not fit for purpose for someone\'s own home."', 'Scottish Conservative social care spokesman Craig Hoy said the "deeply worrying" report pointed to further shortcomings in the government\'s response to care homes.', 'He added: "It appears that as well as being lax in allowing untested patients to be discharged from hospital to care homes, the simultaneously strict restrictions imposed on those within care homes caused such harm and distress to residents that they may have led to further deaths too. ', '"This toxic mix of the casual and severe had deadly consequences in Scotland\'s care homes and it\'s clear lessons must be learned by SNP ministers."', 'Last month, Deputy First Minister John Swinney said the Scottish government had tried to create the "safest environment possible" in care homes early in the pandemic.', 'A spokesperson for the inquiry said the academic papers contained the views of the authors and did not represent the position of the inquiry, which will carry out its own investigations.', '<b class="ssrcss-hmf8ql-BoldText e5tfeyi3">The areas the reports looked at</b>', "A report by Edinburgh University on education said the pandemic represented a setback for Scotland's young people.", 'It highlighted mental and physical health as a significant issue, and said lockdown and school closures "exacerbated existing disadvantage".', 'It also says that Scotland responded rapidly to the emergency of March 2020 and the following two years saw "significant innovation, creativity and collaboration".', 'The report says the move to online teaching provided some continuity for pupils, but there were issues around access to technology and resources.', 'It also pointed out that staff worked far beyond their already heavy workloads during lockdown.', "Another report was produced by Edinburgh University's Usher Network for Covid-19 Evidence Reviews (Uncover) on pandemic planning ", 'It said: "The preparation that had taken place prior to the pandemic enabled Scotland to respond quickly on multiple fronts, from NHS intensive care capacity to legislative drafting for emergency measures.', '"However, prior emergency planning exercises had also identified gaps in Scotland\'s readiness, including in respect of PPE availability and training, and clarity of guidance, which had not been fully addressed by the time the pandemic began."', 'A report from Professor Francis Greene at the University of Edinburgh said the Scottish government had been "ill-prepared for the pandemic" and that its strategy had been reactive rather than proactive.', 'It said the support provided to businesses by the UK and Scottish governments was a "significant factor" in explaining the "muted impact" on businesses and employees.', 'While the support was welcomed by Scottish businesses, there were "significant concerns" about fraud and losses, the targeting of such schemes, and difficulties in accessing support.', 'And while support for those in need was also welcomed, there were concerns about the impact of the pandemic on the household finances of those on low incomes in the future.', 'World Cup winner Jürgen Klinsmann invites you to subscribe to his daily World Cup newsletter.', '© 2022 BBC.
