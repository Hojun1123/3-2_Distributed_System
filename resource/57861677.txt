', 'But these laboratory studies do not show how much mask laws prevent transmission in the real world, where masks may be ill fitting or worn inconsistently or not over the mouth and nose.', 'And even analysing changes to cases and hospital admissions, it is difficult to pick out the effect of mask-wearing in particular.', 'Places where masks are mandatory are more likely to also have laws around social distancing or border controls. ', 'And people who choose to wear masks might be more likely to also take other precautions, such as opening windows or avoiding crowds.  ', 'A study <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2781283" class="ssrcss-k17ofw-InlineLink e1no5rhv0">in Kansas</a> found local areas in the state went from having the highest numbers of cases to seeing fewer hospital admissions and almost half as many deaths after introducing mask rules, compared with those that did not, even when no other rules had been introduced at the same time.

', "If in a train carriage, there are five infected people without face coverings and one healthy masked person - that one mask is having to block five people's worth of virus.
